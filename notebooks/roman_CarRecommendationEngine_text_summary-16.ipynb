'Corvette', 'model': 'C6', 'interior': 'The driver is presented with a simple dash on the Corvette and it’s all very easy to read and understand. An electrically adjusted drivers seat helps find the ideal driving position for most people, though some may find the steering wheel doesn’t have the range of movement necessary to get perfectly comfortable. The driver has good all-round vision in the Corvette thanks to the large glass rear hatch, through reversing can be tricky as it’s hard to judge where the rear of the car is from the driver’s seat. This is why most owners opt for rear parking sensors. Cabin quality is good, but some of the plastics look cheap next to the best Europe has to offer. The Corvette is a big car, so in theory there should be plenty of interior space. Unfortunately this isn’t the case and head, leg and shoulder room are all tighter than you may expect. The seats are generously padded, while the climate control is quick to cool or warm the cabin very effectively whatever the outside temperature. The C6 and Z06 are both pleasingly refined at all speeds on UK roads, with road noise suppressed, unless you give the throttle a hefty stab to make the big V8 motor growl. The interior got an upgrade in 2008 and although it’s still poorly packaged and slightly cramped, the dash area is now leather-wrapped (with a choice of two colours) and some chrome has been added around the dials and switches.', 'practicality': 'The Corvette offers its owners a taste of jet-fighter technology with its head-up display to show speed and revs. It may seem like a gimmick, but this system keeps the driver’s eyes on the road for more of the time. Corvette also provides the more expected safety features of twin front and side airbags and a full ESP traction control system. One of the Corvette’s big plusses is the amount of space it provides for luggage under that huge rear glass canopy. Below it lies a sizeable boot that can take a set of golf clubs with room to spare, while in the cabin there are plenty of places to store loose items. The big negative for the Corvette is its width, which makes it a pain to thread through narrow city streets or car parks designed with small European cars in mind, while being left-hand drive only compounds this.', 'engines': 'The standard C6 has a meaty 6.0-litre V8 engine, normally driving through a six-speed manual gearbox, while the Z06 goes the whole hog with a 505bhp 7.0-litre V8. There’s nothing sophisticated about either engine, but there’s also no doubting the punch they pack, with the standard car seeing off 0-62mph in 4.3 seconds and the Z06 dropping that to just 3.9 seconds. Both cars’ engines rev more sedately than European alternatives like the Porsche 911, but the Corvette engines just keep on delivering more and more power with a deep and booming V8 sound from the exhausts. The lazy V8 nature makes both Corvettes easy to meander through traffic, while the optional automatic gearbox for the 6.0 C6 makes it even more of a laid back cruiser. The C6 has masses of grip thanks to its huge tyres, but there’s also an adept suspension system at work to help the car through corners with great control and balance. The suspension is set very firmly and on UK roads the occupants feel every jitter in the road surface. It also takes a while to learn how to drive the Corvette smoothly as the steering is almost too quick to react and does not have as much feel or sensitivity as the likes of a Porsche 911. It’s a large car for many UK roads, emphasised by the driver sitting down low and the steering wheel being on the left-hand side. Fortunately, the brakes are more than a match for the car’s performance, and the Z06’s brakes in particular are exceptional.', 'mpg_running_costs': 'The C6 and Z06 are markedly cheaper than most of their competitors with similar performance and specification. However, limited buyer interest also means the Corvette loses value more rapidly before levelling out at a point where enthusiasts will become very interested. Running any car with a sizeable V8 engine is not cheap, but the Z06’s 24mpg is not as damaging to your bank account as some rivals’. That said, insurance and servicing will generate big bills. The C6 performs miserably on the eco front as would any car offering this kind of performance. With an average of 304g/km CO2 across the range, its emissions are high. The range is also disappointingly thirsty, averaging 21mpg. The big V8 engines may produce plenty of power, but they’re under-stressed and proven designs that won’t give trouble if regularly serviced. It’s the same for the gearboxes, suspension and the rest of the car. The interior plastics are also durable, but it’s a shame that Corvette has not made them look more attractive and better finished.'}, {'manufacturer': 'Corvette', 'model': 'Stingray', 'interior': 'n/a', 'practicality': 'n/a', 'engines': 'n/a', 'mpg_running_costs': 'n/a'}]\n"]}],"source":["files = os.listdir(directory)\n","all_review_list = []\n","for current_file in files:\n","    with open(directory + \"/\" + current_file, 'r') as f:\n","        loaded_list = json.load(f)\n","        all_review_list.append(loaded_list)\n","\n","\n","print(all_review_list[-1])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":20,"status":"ok","timestamp":1711021664857,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Zhvanskiy","userId":"11978303123960557609"},"user_tz":0},"id":"bXTFXvxU854y","outputId":"068318e5-59b2-47fb-afe0-5e828184c531"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Shape of the list: 59 rows x 12 columns\n"]}],"source":["num_rows = len(all_review_list)\n","num_cols = len(all_review_list[0]) if all_review_list else 0\n","print(f\"Shape of the list: {num_rows} rows x {num_cols} columns\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"id":"rydXdlDw88um","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711021664857,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":19,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Zhvanskiy","userId":"11978303123960557609"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["def flatten(lst):\n","    flat_list = []\n","    for item in lst:\n","        if isinstance(item, list):\n","            flat_list.extend(flatten(item))\n","        else:\n","            flat_list.append(item)\n","    return flat_list\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{"id":"CwptTLYl8-hy","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711021664857,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":18,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Zhvanskiy","userId":"11978303123960557609"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["all_review_list_flat = flatten(all_review_list)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":18,"status":"ok","timestamp":1711021664857,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Zhvanskiy","userId":"11978303123960557609"},"user_tz":0},"id":"AkHUJRih9BOS","outputId":"a1d157c6-6e42-4bd7-9688-a717cadaaf34"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Shape of the list: 1012 rows x 6 columns\n"]}],"source":["num_rows = len(all_review_list_flat)\n","num_cols = len(all_review_list_flat[0]) if all_review_list_flat else 0\n","print(f\"Shape of the list: {num_rows} rows x {num_cols} columns\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"id":"Q84Nc7YY9CTg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711021664857,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":17,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Zhvanskiy","userId":"11978303123960557609"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["df_reviews = pd.DataFrame(all_review_list_flat)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{"id":"8L7UZUIb9IEY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711021664857,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":17,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Zhvanskiy","userId":"11978303123960557609"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Remove rows containing 'n/a' entries\n","df_reviews = df_reviews[(df_reviews != 'n/a').all(axis=1)]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":17,"status":"ok","timestamp":1711021664857,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Zhvanskiy","userId":"11978303123960557609"},"user_tz":0},"id":"vkn6kk5S9ElB","outputId":"5ca175c9-96b2-473d-9dea-25e890523ceb"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   manufacturer    model                                           interior  \\\n","0           TVR  Cerbera  Seats are snug and supportive.

There\\u2019s lots of physical buttons and dials rather than touch sensitive icons which makes it refreshingly simple to use. It\\u2019s also very well screwed together, feeling far more solid than the A-Class and with nicer materials than the A3 . Put simply, it\\u2019s one of the best hatchback interiors out there. BMW\\u2019s Operating System 7.0 is fitted as standard to the 1 Series. The functionality on offer is superb, with the Android-like menu system allowing web browsing and other apps, as well as the usual sat-nav, media and telephone functions. The menus aren\\u2019t quite as clearly laid out as you would find in an Audi A3, but the iDrive rotary dial control method is incredibly easy to use. Multiple shortcut buttons on the centre console are also worth their weight in gold due to how intuitive they are to use when on the move. The 10.25-inch digital dashboard display, however, is less of a success. Its fairly basic setup feels better suited to the 1 Series than the 8 Series, for example, but the level of functionality compared to what Mercedes-Benz and Audi offers, is lacking. Users aren\\u2019t able to cycle the entire screen through different modes, instead seeing only a small portion change instead. The virtual dial design, too, isn\\u2019t as clear as BMW\\u2019s previously excellent analogue equivalents. A 9.2-inch\\u202fhead-up display\\u202fis also available as an optional accessory. If you can stretch to the extra cost, we reckon it\\u2019s well worth speccing \\u2013 offering clear, easy-to-understand graphics. BMW Gesture Control also features as an optional extra, allowing the user to change settings such as the stereo volume using just hand gestures. In action, it\\u2019s a little bit of a waste of time \\u2013 it\\u2019s quicker and easier to just reach across and turn the volume knob or use the controls on the steering wheel. Drivers of all sizes shouldn\\u2019t have any difficulty getting comfortable in the 1 Series, especially since the level of headroom feels noticeably more generous up front than it does in the rear. What\\u2019s more, the pedals are flanked by enough space for a well-sized footrest, while the cabin as a whole feels generously proportioned. Versions of the 1 Series we\\u2019ve driven so far boast excellent refinement across the board, from the hushed 118d engine to the minimal amounts of tyre and wind noise. The M135i\\u2019s electric sports seats and regular electric seats are both very comfortable. The former in particular, offered adjustable bolsters that fill with air in order to give more support to occupants during hard cornering. We were also impressed by the level of adjustability on offer, especially with regards to the height of the seat base and steering wheel reach.\",\n          \"VW\\u2019s taken the opportunity with the Multivan to divert from its van-like heritage and plop in a dashboard more akin to many of its passenger cars \\u2013 and totally unlike any commercial vehicle. As a result, you get two digital screens as standard \\u2013 a large 10.0-inch infotainment display as well as the \\u2018Digital Cockpit\\u2019 driver information display in place of conventional dials. Connectivity is via USB-C \\u2013 very 2021 \\u2013 while the uncluttered interface includes the gear selector way up on the dash in order to save floor space. The result takes a little getting used to but does work quite well, with caveats. For example, it\\u2019s great having a highly configurable digital dial pack to display all your information clearly and effectively. However, there are areas where we\\u2019d like to see some physical controls, notably the climate control which is awkward to adjust through the central touchscreen. Material quality is high, though, much closer to VW\\u2019s passenger cars than its commercial vehicles. Even the base-spec Life model features a two-tone dashboard, with cream-coloured plastics making the interior feel far lighter and airier than many of its rivals. The same 10.0-inch infotainment display features in the Multivan as in many VW passenger cars. While it looks good and has a high resolution, it can be awkward to navigate and buggy \\u2013 we experienced one crash while we had the Multivan on test that necessitated turning the entire van off and on again to fix. At least Apple CarPlay and Android Auto come as standard, allowing you to bypass the majority of the factory interface if you want to. And they work wirelessly, though the USB-C ports are ideally sited just below a grippy shelf intended to hold your smartphone securely. When it comes to passenger comfort for seven people at a time the VW Multivan\\u2019s right up there with the Mercedes-Benz V-Class . Both vans provide generous accommodation for up to seven adults, with loads of room for all and plenty of creature comforts to make sure everyone\\u2019s entertained. USB-C ports in all three rows help keep devices topped up while the sliding centre table provides storage and a space to eat or work from. There are climate control vents in the rear to stop things becoming stuffy, though the sliding windows in the rear doors are deleted if you opt for a high-strength window tint. Refinement is seriously good, too, with limited wind or road noise despite the bluff front. Engine noise depends very much on which powertrain you choose, with the lower-powered petrols becoming quite vocal when revved. None are what you\\u2019d call noisy, though.\",\n          \"The interior takes design cues from a number of other Chevrolet models and some thought has been given to the materials used. The seats are trimmed in a good quality fabric and the main interior trim is of a substantial and soft-touch feel. There are the odd pieces of light feeling, easily scratched, plastic in places \\u2013 such as the cubbyhole on top of the dash \\u2013 but the overall impression is of a quality-feeling cabin. The Aveo also features the chunky wheel that\\u2019s shared with Vauxhall models like the Insignia. Front visibility isn\\u2019t great however. The front pillars, depending on your seating position, can interfere with your view of what\\u2019s around the corner, meaning you have to lean forwards to make sure the road is clear when you come to corners or junctions. Despite its diminutive size and low price, the Aveo doesn\\u2019t feel cheap or uncomfortable on the inside. There\\u2019s lots of headroom and four adults can be seated in relative comfort. You can even squeeze three people in the back seats \\u2013 although if they weren\\u2019t intimately acquainted before the trip, then they will be after it. The seats are supportive and don\\u2019t irritate, even on longer drives. There is no centre armrest for rear passengers but higher spec models get front armrests \\u2013 quite a \\u2018big car\\u2019 touch and a benefit on longer trips. The steering wheel also adjusts for rise and reach. Even on the motorway the Aveo proves refined and quiet, with only some wind noise from the front pillars at higher speeds.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"practicality\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 577,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The five-door-only 1 Series is 34mm wider and 13mm higher than its predecessor yet, unusually, also comes in 5mm shorter. This latter measurement is owing to improved packaging from the front-wheel drive powertrain and rotated engine (so it\\u2019s now transverse-mounted, meaning it\\u2019s positioned across the engine bay rather than lengthways), allowing the car to be shorter without compromising passenger or boot space. As a result, kneeroom for rear seat passengers is up by 33mm \\u2013 and it really shows. It\\u2019s a marked improvement over the previous-generation car, if not quite as generous as what the Ford Focus or Volkswagen Golf offers, let alone the SEAT Leon and Skoda Octavia . Headroom, however, is still a little disappointing despite the car\\u2019s taller profile. Perched on the rear seats, you\\u2019ll feel like the base is positioned high meaning that anyone over 5ft 9inch will find their head touching the roof lining. The middle seat, too, is best limited to kids or smaller adults \\u2013 partly due to the chunky central tunnel running through the car\\u2019s cabin. Boot space comes in at 380 litres with the rear seats in place and 1,200 with them folded down. This compares favourably with the Mercedes-Benz A-Class (370-1,210 litres) and matches the Volkswagen Golf in the former category (380-1,270 litres). Lifting heavy bags in shouldn\\u2019t be too tricky thanks to a minimal loading lip and a space free of major intrusions. While an electrically operated tailgate is available too. Again, though, there are rivals with far bigger boots such as the Seat Leon and simply gigantic Skoda Octavia. Cabin storage, meanwhile, is adequate in the back and plentiful in the front thanks to generously proportioned door pockets and a pair of nicely sized cupholders. The 1 Series is no wider than a\\u202fVolkswagen Golf. However, it is a little longer, meaning it\\u2019s well worth taking careful and exact measurements of your garage before committing to a 1 Series. Note, too, that it\\u2019s also taller than your average hatchback \\u2013 so bear in mind the height at which your garage door mechanism sits at. The optional Reversing Assistant should also help with narrow garages, automatically backing the car out following exactly the same path as it entered with. View dimensions in the BMW 1 Series specs pages Crash testers at Euro NCAP gave the 1 Series a full five star rating. The 1 Series\\u2019 platform has been tried and tested on other five-star safety rated models (including the MINI Clubman and BMW X1 ) and features the usual array of hi-tech safety aids, including: \",\n          \"The VW Multivan\\u2019s available in two body lengths \\u2013 Standard and Long. The two models share the same wheelbase but Long vans have more rear overhang. Regardless of which you choose, you get a highly flexible interior with seven seats as standard. In most models, the seats are set out in a 2-2-3 layout, while an optional six-seater with captain\\u2019s chairs in all three rows adds a further layer of luxury. Accessing the third row is easy, with the centre seats sliding well out of the way. All the rear seats are on rails and can be lifted out, adding to the flexibility. There\\u2019s also a useful sliding storage unit, which provides cupholders and stowage for smaller items as well as a full-height table from which rear occupants can eat or work. Legroom and headroom are good in all three rows, and there\\u2019s space for three adults to sit across the rear bench \\u2013 though if they\\u2019re burly, you can slide the middle seat forward a couple of clicks to prevent their shoulders all bumping together. The cabin width makes this easier than in a Citroen Spacetourer, though a Mercedes V-Class or Ford Tourneo Custom is wider still. You can also swivel the middle row of seats for a more convivial conference-style seating arrangement, though not all models are capable of this and you do need to fully remove the seats to rotate them. As with any van-like MPV, the Multivan can carry a vast amount of kit if you remove all the rear seats. However, that\\u2019s quite an undertaking, and you do need to store them when they\\u2019ve been taken out, unlike rival seven-seaters like the Peugeot 5008 where all seats fold totally flat into the floor. Luggage space with all seven seats in place is limited. Though it\\u2019s quoted at 469 litres and 763 litres for Standard and Long vans respectively, that\\u2019s when loaded right up to the roof \\u2013 space under the rear window is rather less generous. If you\\u2019re regularly planning to load the van up with seven adults and their luggage, you\\u2019ll want the Long model. Take all the seats out and you\\u2019ll liberate a cavernous 3,672 litres, or 4005 litres in the Long model. There\\u2019s a maximum length of 2.43m and 2.63m respectively. Storage inside is good, with a large glovebox and smaller storage cubbies on the dashtop. Stacked door bins provide space for odds and ends, there\\u2019s a useful parcel shelf and a cupholder for every rear occupant. There\\u2019s also lots of space in between the front seats and between the two middle seats to seat extra bags on the floor if needed. The Multivan\\u2019s usefully square dimensions at the rear, big mirrors and good visibility make reverse parking easy, aided by standard parking sensors and a rear-view camera. The front is a little trickier to judge, with a more substantial bonnet area than its Caravelle predecessor that\\u2019s not especially easy to see from the driver\\u2019s seat. Opt for the Style model and you\\u2019ll get Park Assist, which is capable of parking the Multivan with no driver input. Regardless of model, this is a large vehicle, so just finding a parking space big enough is likely to be your biggest challenge. Large MPVs don\\u2019t come much safer than the VW Multivan. When tested by Euro NCAP in May 2022 it scored the highest-possible five-star rating, scoring exceptionally well in three out of four categories, with a marginally weaker score for Vulnerable Road Users possibly due to the car\\u2019s bluff frontage. Ratings of 90 and 89 per cent for adult and child occupants respectively are highly impressive, aided by a plethora of airbags including a centre airbag between driver and front passenger. A score of 87 per cent in the Safety Assist category, meanwhile, acknowledges the effectiveness of the standard autonomous emergency braking system and lane-keeping aids . We found the latter reasonably unobtrusive on all kinds of roads, a plus point in our books. Other safety equipment that comes as standard is road sign recognition, adaptive cruise control and automatic post-collision braking, while Style models come with blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert.\",\n          \"The Chevrolet Aveo received five stars in Euro NCAP testing, performing well with regards to both adult and child protection. This is partly thanks to extensive use of high strength steel and impact-absorbing structures. Standard safety equipment includes ABS, electronic stability control, traction control, six airbags and a braking system that activates to prevent the Aveo rolling over. All five seats get three-point seatbelts, with pretensioners, while pedestrian safety is taken into account with an energy-absorbing bumper system and a specially designed bonnet. A collapsible pedal assembly is fitted to reduce leg injury. Also available is a speed limiter function that provides an audio alert when the driver exceeds a set limit. The interior has been well thought out with numerous features aimed at improving its practicality and appeal. The dash gets an upper glove box with two compartments and connections for USB devices, allowing owners to plug in phones and MP3 players. A second glovebox is fitted below the dash, while there are large pockets on both sides of the stereo for phones or CDs. There are also three cupholders \\u2013 two for the front and one for the rear. One neat touch is a small slot in the centre console that holds parking tickets or cards, allowing you to retrieve them quickly and easily when needed. The boot holds a decent 290 litres with the rear seats up, on a par with the competition. There is an underfloor storage area as well as tie-down hooks to secure loose loads. The rear seat has a 60/40 split and with the seats down luggage space increases to 653 litres.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"engines\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 577,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The BMW 1 Series is available with three petrol and three diesel engines. Most models are front-wheel drive, while xDrive all-wheel drive is also available. What you can\\u2019t have is a plug-in hybrid unlike with the Audi A3 and Mercedes A-Class . The range kicks off with the 118i. It\\u2019s a three-cylinder 1.5-litre turbocharged petrol engine and despite being the cheapest and slowest petrol model on offer, its 0-62mph time of 8.5 seconds is still punchy. It\\u2019s only available with front-wheel drive , but there is either a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission to choose from. The diesel range also starts with a 1.5-litre, the 116d. It\\u2019s available in front-wheel drive form with either a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. This is the slowest of the 1 Series with a 0-62mph time of 10.1 seconds and it feels like it too. Next up is the 118d. Using a four-cylinder 2.0-litre diesel engine, its 0-62mph sprint (8.4 seconds) is much healthier than the 116d. Front-wheel drive only, gearbox choice is between the six-speed manual and seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. The 118d is one of the best sellers in the 1 Series range and it\\u2019s not hard to see why. Incredibly smooth and refined, it still offers respectable performance figures and feels an accomplished motorway cruiser. We haven\\u2019t yet tried the manual version, but the eight-speed Steptronic automatic transmission is a superb gearbox delivering slick, well-timed shifts. As an all-rounder, the 118d is hard to beat. Finally, the 120d xDrive comes as standard with the seven-speed automatic gearbox and all-wheel drive. This is the fastest diesel (0-62mph in 7 seconds) and it makes for an effortless motorway cruiser. But our money is still on the 118d. The 265hp 128ti is a front-wheel drive Volkswagen Golf GTI rival. The only gearbox is an eight-speed automatic. You get a more heavily tuned version of the 128ti\\u2019s 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine with 306hp in the M135i. With all four wheels being driven through the eight-speed automatic \\u2018box, 0-62mph takes a blistering 4.8sec. BMW\\u2019s marketing strategy often focuses on the brand\\u2019s reputation for delivering \\u2018drivers\\u2019 cars\\u2019, yet the 1 Series has sometimes struggled to fulfil this. The previous generation car wasn\\u2019t as sharp to drive as a number of key rivals (Mazda 3 and Volkswagen Golf to name two), so the switch from being predominantly rear-wheel drive to front-wheel drive could be welcome. As a result, the 1 Series handles in a similar manner to the aforementioned Golf. That means grip, stability and performance levels are all impressive, with the emphasis skewed towards safety and stability more than ever. Some drivers may bemoan this, yet it\\u2019s likely the vast majority will be more interested in the improved cruising manners. Wind, road and engine noise are as quiet as it gets for a car of this size, while the ride comfort on adaptive suspension is agreeable \\u2013 if slightly towards the firmer end of the scale. It also feels generally more grown-up than the previous car, feeling more polished all-round and better-suited to its front-wheel drive layout. Not quite abandoning its sporting roots, BMW has given the 1 Series a duo of hi-tech driver assistance aids \\u2013 namely ARB (near actuator wheel slip limitation) and BMW Performance Control (yaw moment distribution). While that may sound confusing, in essence the former has been designed to reduce losses of grip from the front wheels when cornering, while the latter is capable of individually braking the inside wheel as required in order to improve agility. Although normal versions of the 1 Series handle well, the M135i does disappoint compared to the best hot hatches out there. It\\u2019s certainly quick and is more agile than the AMG A35, but is nowhere near as much fun as a Toyota GR Yaris . The latest performance model to be added to the lineup is the 128ti. This is front-wheel drive, and is a right laugh. It scrabbles out of corners like an errant puppy and it\\u2019s nearly as fast as the full-fat M135i, only a considerable amount less money. Ride is still very harsh though, and the lairy graphics down the side of the car won\\u2019t be to everyone\\u2019s tastes.\",\n          \"At the time of writing VW offers the Multivan with a range of four engines \\u2013 two petrol, one diesel, and one plug-in hybrid . All of them are mated to a DSG automatic gearbox , with six ratios for the plug-in hybrid and seven for all the others. This is a quick-shifting automatic and pairs well with all the engine options \\u2013 it really makes driving the Multivan effortless. Proceedings kick off with a 136 hp 1.5-litre petrol. We\\u2019ll be honest \\u2013 it feels sluggish and not quite up to the task of ferrying around the Multivan\\u2019s vast bulk, especially if you add passengers to the mix. If you\\u2019ve got your heart set on a petrol then the 204hp 2.0-litre is far more muscular, though it does need revving hard to make the most of its extra muscle. Both of these engines are smooth and, at low revs, very quiet, making them decent motorway cruisers. However, the diesel or plug-in hybrid options suit the Multivan much better. The diesel in the Multivan is the same hardworking 2.0-litre TDI as you\\u2019ll find in thousands of VW\\u2019s passenger cars. It\\u2019s not quick, but it feels muscular enough and has plenty of torque to cope with a full load. It\\u2019s also very efficient in comparison to the petrols. The Multivan eHybrid uses the same plug-in powertrain as many of VW\\u2019s hybrid passenger cars, and you might be surprised to hear how well it works in such a bulky vehicle. When the battery and petrol engine work in conjunction there\\u2019s more than enough shove for a fully-laden van, whether overtaking or punting down a sliproad at high speed. The electric motor is powerful enough to pootle around town though if you\\u2019re heading onto faster roads you won\\u2019t find yourself achieving the full 29 mile range it\\u2019s officially capable of. Still, even when the battery is discharged there\\u2019s some in reserve to make the Multivan eHybrid a responsive, relatively quick and refined cruiser. There\\u2019s no escaping the sheer size of the Multivan, but the driving experience is far more polished than it was in the old Caravelle. The driving position is less upright and more car-like, and the steering more direct and requiring fewer turns of the wheel to get the same result. This makes it reasonably relaxing to pilot on twisting roads and around town. With limited body roll for such a tall vehicle, the Multivan is confidence-inspiring to drive and shouldn\\u2019t result in too much carsickness from its rear occupants. At the same time, it\\u2019s very comfortable, with a stiff structure that reduces rattles and shimmies. Optionally available is Dynamic Chassis Control which can control how stiff the suspension feels \\u2013 but the regular passive setup is so good we wouldn\\u2019t bother.\",\n          \"The Aveo is available with a choice of 1.2-litre and 1.4-litre petrol engines, while a 1.3-litre diesel in three power outputs is also on offer. The petrol engines provide adequate performance but they do have to be worked hard when you want to overtake \\u2013 at which point they become noisy. It\\u2019s around busy city streets and tight town roads that the Aveo\\u2019s engines work best, with good acceleration from 0-30mph. The 1.2-litre manual delivers 86bhp and 115Nm of pulling power, allowing the Aveo to accelerate to 62mph in 13.4 seconds. With the more poweful 100bhp 1.4-litre the Aveo will get from zero to 62mph in 12.2s. Chevrolet expects the 1.2-litre option to be the most popular and with such close performance figures there\\u2019s not much benefit in picking the slightly bigger engine. The diesels are all 1.3-litre units and are available in 75bhp, 95bhp and 95bhp \\u2018Eco\\u2019 specifications. They\\u2019re a little more gruff and agricultural than you might expect, but at steady speed they\\u2019re quiet and smooth. The diesel engines are more flexible and relaxing than the petrol versions, and surprisingly good fun to drive. The 1.3-litre diesel, with 95bhp, will accelerate the Aveo from 0-62mph in 11.7 seconds. A five-speed manual gearbox is standard on most models, while a six-speed automatic is available on the 1.4-litre. The standard 95bhp diesel model gets a six-speed manual. The automatic gearbox is slower and less efficient than the manual versions, and it can cause a racket when accelerating, but the shift quality is acceptable and the gearbox operates unobtrusively around town. Chevrolet\\u2019s marketing material claims that the Aveo offers a sporty driving experience that contributes to its appeal. Don\\u2019t buy one on this basis \\u2013 the Aveo is not a car for those who want an involving drive. As a car to get from A to B, however, it proves very competent. There is some body roll in the corners, but it feels secure on the road with lots of grip. The real criticism that can be levied against it \\u2013 and why it\\u2019s not a car for those who want to be engaged \\u2013 is the lack of feel and feedback through the steering. Despite this the Aveo is easy to drive and ideal for those who want to complete their journey with little fuss.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"mpg_running_costs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 577,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Unsurprisingly, the BMW badge attracts a premium list price with the cheapest 1 Series significantly more expensive than an entry-level Ford Focus or Volkswagen Golf . However, PCP finance and lease deals are more competitive and could see you driving around in a BMW for the same monthly payment as a \\u2018less desirable\\u2019 badge. There are three petrols and three diesels on offer. Diesels might not be fashionable, but in the 1 Series they provide strong fuel economy. The basic 118i petrol will be enough for most people, as it combines low economy and CO2 emissions. Truth be told, the performance models, the 128ti and M135i xDrive still return reasonable levels considering the power they offer. We should point out that automatic, all-wheel drive cars, such as the 120d xDrive aren\\u2019t as economical as front-wheel drive manual models. As with all fuel economy figures, real world returns vary due to factors such as driving style and the size of wheel fitted to your car. On paper, the 116d is the most fuel efficient, and the M135i is the least. View detailed MPG and CO2 figures on the BMW 1 Series specs pages The 1 Series comes with BMW\\u2019s standard three-year unlimited mileage warranty that includes breakdown cover. The unlimited mileage warranty is a rarity among manufacturers, even if the three-year limit is below that of Hyundai and Kia. BMW offers several service plans. One of the more popular ones involves paying up-front for four years\\u2019 worth of services. Although BMW\\u2019s current reputation for reliability varies from model to model, this model is proving reliable. It has been subject to two recalls however. One to do with airbags and the other concerning the camshaft. If you\\u2019re buying a used 1 Series, ensure that all potential recalls have been addressed by a certified garage. Read owner\\u2019s reviews on the BMW 1 Series\",\n          \"Running costs for the Volkswagen Multivan depend very much on which engine you choose. Starting with the pure petrol models, you can expect these to be thirsty \\u2013 particularly the higher-powered 2.0-litre TSI. Both of these engines require working hard especially when heavily loaded, and the result is likely to be sub-30mpg around town and barely cresting 30 on a long run. A much more sensible option for most people will be the diesels, which may even top 40mpg on a long run and have the torquier characteristics required for effortless work when heavily laden. Official fuel economy for the 150hp model is 43mpg. That\\u2019s an improvement on the equivalent Ford Tourneo Custom. An interesting choice is the 1.4-litre eHybrid model. This is a plug-in hybrid , capable of up to 29 miles when fully charged. Interestingly, we found it efficient even with a discharged battery, seeing 38mpg average over 800 miles of motorway runs. Charge up at home every night and make the most of that battery for short runs and you may barely need to use the petrol engine at all, making the eHybrid Multivan very cost-effective indeed \\u2013 albeit at a slight purchase price premium compared to the diesels. CO2 emissions, meanwhile, are relatively high for all but the eHybrid model \\u2013 though they\\u2019re on a par with most of the Multivan\\u2019s opposition. Servicing for a Multivan should take place through a VW Van Centre. There are 94 of these around the country and they provide commercial vehicle-quality service, essential particularly if you\\u2019re running your Multivan as part of a business. Fixed-price servicing and maintenance should make repairs painless, though the Multivan\\u2019s warranty is a rather stingy three years \\u2013 compared to the ten years Toyota offers on a Proace. The VW Multivan is based on a tried and tested set of mechanicals, used underneath just about every VW passenger car in the last few years. You can expect strong reliability from the turbocharged petrol and diesel engines, though the plug-in hybrid model has already had one recall for a potential fire risk. There are rather a lot of electronics that can and sometimes do go wrong, however, from the infotainment crashing to the advanced safety aids misbehaving. However, you should be buoyed by the fact that three VW vans feature in the top 10 of the FN50 van reliability survey.\",\n          \"Aveo owners won\\u2019t have to worry about big bills \\u2013 it\\u2019s cheap to service and insure, while the 1.2-litre petrol will return an average economy of 51mpg. The 1.3-litre Ecodiesel model is claimed to be capable of 78mpg, the 95bhp diesel engine 69mpg and the 75bhp engine 76mpg. The cleanest petrol model is the 1.2-litre eco manual option which emits 119g/km of CO2. This compares well to cars like Citroen\\u2019s more expensive C3, which emits 137g/km of CO2. The automatic transmission option does increase emissions considerably, so go for the manual box if you want to save both the environment and a little money \\u2013 the road tax is cheaper for the manual versions. Diesel versions are also very clean \\u2013 the 75bhp and 95bhp \\u2018Eco\\u2019 engines emit less than 100g/km of CO2. This version feels quite robust and no major problems should be expected. The technology and powertrains used are well developed, having being shared with other cars, and problems are rare.

There are 150 hp , 190hp and 245hp versions of the petrol, and 150hp and 200hp diesels. The eHybrid plug-in hybrid model is on its way, but isn\\u2019t on sale in the UK yet, so picking the one for you shouldn\\u2019t be too tricky a task. View full specs The two petrols available are a 1.5-litre TSI with 150hp and 250Nm, and 190hp or 245hp 2.0-litre TSI. The 1.5-litre is the most popular engine for the Tarraco, and as with other cars we\\u2019ve tried with this engine, it\\u2019s smooth and refined. Performance is stronger than you might expect, but the lack of torque compared with the diesels means it doesn\\u2019t have great pulling power. We spent a 1,000-mile week in one, and that lack of go does become a bit of a chore in this situation. This is compounded by a lazy automatic transmission that is sluggish to respond in Eco mode, and a little too eager to drop gears in Sport mode. In which case, it\\u2019s either too relaxing or not relaxing enough. There\\u2019s stronger performance from the 190hp and 245hp petrols. However, the lower-powered 2.0-litre version is down on low-end shove compared with that car, which can be noticeable when loaded up with passengers. The DSG gearbox can also make it feel a little sluggish like it can in the diesel. This is less so with the sporty 245hp version, but you do still need to work it hard to extract rapid performance from it. View full specs The diesels available in the Tarraco are familiar 2.0-litre TDI units \\u2013 with a choice of 150hp or 200hp. Go for the 150hp version and you\\u2019ll get a choice of a manual gearbox and front-wheel drive, or seven-speed DSG automatic and 4Drive all-wheel drive. The manual gearbox is particularly slick and easy to use, and it has strong overtaking performance, as long as you\\u2019re in the right gear. The 200hp 2.0-litre TDI is comes exclusively with 4Drive and a seven-speed DSG transmission. In action, though, it can feel very sluggish when pulling away from junctions or at roundabouts, needing a good prod of the throttle to get the car moving \\u2013 especially as it can try to move away in second gear when in Normal driving mode. The Tarraco\\u2019s been set-up to feel more engaging to drive than its closest seven-seater rivals, with steering and suspension set-up tailored to the Spanish brand\\u2019s zesty ethos. For those who enjoy driving on B-roads, it certainly won\\u2019t be a disappointment. The Tarraco\\u2019s steering turns into corners sharply, with a decent amount of communication about what the front wheels are up to \\u2013 although its weighting is on the light side, even in Sport mode . Similarly, bodyroll is kept tidily in check, in part because the suspension\\u2019s 20mm lower than the Kodiaq\\u2019s, hunkering it down a bit. It\\u2019s best to think of the Tarraco as being an SUV for keen drivers \\u2013 at least compared with the Volkswagen and Skoda \\u2013 rather than a sporty car that happens to have seven seats. Certainly in FR trim with the larger wheels and lower-profile tyres offered as standard, it feels very quick and responsive in the the bends. While this is all well and good in terms of feeling assured and responsive for such a large car on a smooth, twisting road, the combination of 20-inch alloy wheels on higher-spec models and less-than-perfect surfaces of UK roads means the Tarraco can tend to fidget and fuss more than we\\u2019d like. It\\u2019s never uncomfortable \\u2013 far from it \\u2013 but it\\u2019s worth trying the Skoda Kodiaq and Volkswagen Tiguan Allspace if your priority is outright comfort.\",\n          \"Alpine is owned by Renault , and if we\\u2019re honest, this is a pairing that doesn\\u2019t conjure up images of quality interiors or well-judged trim material. But the A110 will blow away your preconceptions about French car interiors, because this is a fabulous effort \\u2013 and all the more impressive considering it\\u2019s the last car sold by Alpine was the mid-1990s A610. Even so, you will find a few switches, stalks and dials lifted from lesser Renault products. Transmission is a simple push-button affair with paddleshifters for those who want to take care of the gearchanges themselves. Again, it\\u2019s functional but works very well \\u2013 and equally, the paddles feel nice to use, even if they don\\u2019t have the machined perfection of the Porsche 718 Cayman\\u2019s. Needless to say, the driving position is spot on, with a perfect relationship between wheel, paddleshifters and pedals \\u2013 and there\\u2019s also plenty of room for drivers of all shapes and sizes. As such, that means as a daily driver, the A110 makes more sense than you\\u2019d imagine. The instrumentation is digital and displayed on a large screen in front of the driver. The display changes depending on the drive mode you select, which works especially well in track mode, where all the extraneous gauges are taken away in favour of lap timer and rev counter. It all works very well indeed. The infotainment set-up is basic and is probably the car\\u2019s weakest link truth be told. However, it\\u2019s functional \\u2013 there\\u2019s not a lot to complain about here \\u2013 and it now features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto , so at least you don\\u2019t have to look too much at the standard set-up. The Alpine A110 really surprises and delights in this department. For a sports car that references a 1960s rally icon, you might be thinking that it\\u2019s going to be an uncomfortable beast. But you couldn\\u2019t be further from the truth. The seats are supportive and a pleasure to sit on, but if you\\u2019re blessed with a wider frame, you might struggle to snuggle in between its side bolsters. Of the three, the GT\\u2019s seats offer the most comfortable environment including seat heating, but the A110S is surprisingly pleasant even for a long drive. R owners aren\\u2019t quite as lucky, with carbon racing seats offering the least padding and a racing harness proving more troublesome than regular seatbelts.\",\n          \"The Roomster uses high-strength steel in key areas of its structure and six airbags (front, side and curtain) are standard, so it\\u2019s little surprise that it was awarded the maximum five star crash safety rating by Euro NCAP. It also has Isofix child seat mounting points in the rear. However originally the ESP stability control system was optional on all but the Scout model. This changed in 2009 and now all cars come with it as standard. A tyre pressure monitoring system is also available as an option, as are cornering front fog lights and headlights that turn with the steering wheel. If the Roomster was only able to offer its 450 litres minimum luggage space, it would still be one of the most practical cars you could buy for the money. However, the luggage space can be increased to 530 litres with all three rear seats still in the car and available for use. The rear seats can be folded or removed, or the two outer seats can be moved closer to the centre of the car to increase shoulder room by taking out the middle seat. The seats are easy to fold and easily light enough for one person to lift them in and out of the car. Other storage space is generous, with two glove compartments and wide door storage bins. Under-seat storage is also available.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":18}],"source":["#convert

An electrically adjusted drivers seat helps find the ideal driving position for most people, though some may find the steering wheel doesn’t have the range of movement necessary to get perfectly comfortable. The driver has good all-round vision in the Corvette thanks to the large glass rear hatch, through reversing can be tricky as it’s hard to judge where the rear of the car is from the driver’s seat. This is why most owners opt for rear parking sensors. Cabin quality is good, but some of the plastics look cheap next to the best Europe has to offer. The Corvette is a big car, so in theory there should be plenty of interior space. Unfortunately this isn’t the case and head, leg and shoulder room are all tighter than you may expect. The seats are generously padded, while the climate control is quick to cool or warm the cabin very effectively whatever the outside temperature. The C6 and Z06 are both pleasingly refined at all speeds on UK roads, with road noise suppressed, unless you give the throttle a hefty stab to make the big V8 motor growl. The interior got an upgrade in 2008 and although it’s still poorly packaged and slightly cramped, the dash area is now leather-wrapped (with a choice of two colours) and some chrome has been added around the dials and switches.', 'practicality': 'The Corvette offers its owners a taste of jet-fighter technology with its head-up display to show speed and revs. It may seem like a gimmick, but this system keeps the driver’s eyes on the road for more of the time. Corvette also provides the more expected safety features of twin front and side airbags and a full ESP traction control system. One of the Corvette’s big plusses is the amount of space it provides for luggage under that huge rear glass canopy. Below it lies a sizeable boot that can take a set of golf clubs with room to spare, while in the cabin there are plenty of places to store loose items. The big negative for the Corvette is its width, which makes it a pain to thread through narrow city streets or car parks designed with small European cars in mind, while being left-hand drive only compounds this.', 'engines': 'The standard C6 has a meaty 6.0-litre V8 engine, normally driving through a six-speed manual gearbox, while the Z06 goes the whole hog with a 505bhp 7.0-litre V8. There’s nothing sophisticated about either engine, but there’s also no doubting the punch they pack, with the standard car seeing off 0-62mph in 4.3 seconds and the Z06 dropping that to just 3.9 seconds. Both cars’ engines rev more sedately than European alternatives like the Porsche 911, but the Corvette engines just keep on delivering more and more power with a deep and booming V8 sound from the exhausts. The lazy V8 nature makes both Corvettes easy to meander through traffic, while the optional automatic gearbox for the 6.0 C6 makes it even more of a laid back cruiser. The C6 has masses of grip thanks to its huge tyres, but there’s also an adept suspension system at work to help the car through corners with great control and balance. The suspension is set very firmly and on UK roads the occupants feel every jitter in the road surface. It also takes a while to learn how to drive the Corvette smoothly as the steering is almost too quick to react and does not have as much feel or sensitivity as the likes of a Porsche 911. It’s a large car for many UK roads, emphasised by the driver sitting down low and the steering wheel being on the left-hand side. Fortunately, the brakes are more than a match for the car’s performance, and the Z06’s brakes in particular are exceptional.', 'mpg_running_costs': 'The C6 and Z06 are markedly cheaper than most of their competitors with similar performance and specification. However, limited buyer interest also means the Corvette loses value more rapidly before levelling out at a point where enthusiasts will become very interested. Running any car with a sizeable V8 engine is not cheap, but the Z06’s 24mpg is not as damaging to your bank account as some rivals’. That said, insurance and servicing will generate big bills. The C6 performs miserably on the eco front as would any car offering this kind of performance. With an average of 304g/km CO2 across the range, its emissions are high. The range is also disappointingly thirsty, averaging 21mpg. The big V8 engines may produce plenty of power, but they’re under-stressed and proven designs that won’t give trouble if regularly serviced. It’s the same for the gearboxes, suspension and the rest of the car. The interior plastics are also durable, but it’s a shame that Corvette has not made them look more attractive and better finished.'}, {'manufacturer': 'Corvette', 'model': 'Stingray', 'interior': 'n/a', 'practicality': 'n/a', 'engines': 'n/a', 'mpg_running_costs': 'n/a'}]\n","=================\n","reviews_for_classification = \n","                  topic                                        review_text\n","0              interior  Seats are snug and supportive.

That’s both good and bad – it does mean there are fewer aspects likely to annoy you as a driver, like the Volkswagen Golf’s unresponsive touchscreens, but there’s not much to surprise or delight either. It’s certainly easy to get along with. The Ceed’s switchgear is all positioned logically, and the standard-fit touchscreen infotainment system has a simple and intuitive interface. It’s just a shame that it’s all so unrelentingly dark – the plastics used aren’t particularly nice to touch, even if they do feel very well put-together. Entry-level Ceeds come with an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system plus a small screen between the dials of the instrument panel. Higher-spec models upgrade both screens, with a larger one in the instrument panel and a 10.25-inch infotainment screen. Fundamentally, though, this is a cosmetic upgrade, and they all work in the same way. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, so even though there’s no sat-nav on the base models you can still connect your phone to figure out where you’re going. And some models feature Kia Connect, which allows you to use a smartphone app to remotely check and control some of the car’s features. The Ceed performs quite well for comfort. There’s plenty of room, as family hatchbacks go, and few sticking points that will irritate on a long trip. The basic seats do lack a little support, but there’s loads of adjustment – they go further back than on many rivals allowing even the tallest drivers to get comfortable. Refinement isn’t bad, either. The petrol engines are quiet and there’s only moderate wind or road noise, though the diesels can be rather clattery.'\n"," 'Yes, other small cars such as Renault Zoe, with its 250-mile claimed range, easily trump the latest e-Up’s 161-mile figure, but given the VW’s aimed at city living, that’s not going to be much of a hindrance. In the real world, depending on individuals’ driving styles and weather conditions, that could dip to 140 miles or be higher than 170. Being a fully electric car, the e-Up itself produces no CO2 to drive , but unless you’re recharging it using renewables, it’s inevitable some will be released in the process of the batteries being replenished. Still, that headline figure of 0g/km of CO2 means that under the current rules it’s VED car tax-free and buyers receive £3,000 from the government in the form of the Plug-in Car Grant when the e-Up’s purchased. It’s commonplace these days for cars to have different driving settings, and the e-Up’s packed with them. With three specific driving modes – controlling the accelerator responsiveness and air-con primarily, Normal is the one for maximum acceleration. Switching to Eco dulls the responses and makes the air-con less effective, while with Eco+ it’s off altogether – best save this for when you’re eking every last gasp from the battery. Additionally, using the gearlever rather than paddles behind the wheel, you can vary the brake energy recuperation levels between four settings. In its weakest setting lifting off the accelerator pedal will have a very gradual slowing down effect, but slot it into B – for Braking – and it’s much more dramatic. Learn to use it well and essentially you can drive it one-pedalled, barely using the brake pedal at all. Compared with exising, sophisticated systems as found on the BMW i3 and Nissan Leaf , it works effectively, but it’s worth noting that even in B mode, the braking is not sufficiently strong enough to warrant activitating the brake lights at the back. For those rare occasions when you need to recharge the car using a conventional three-pin plug, expect the Volkswagen to be hooked-up for 13-16 hours before the batteries are back up to 100%, making a dedicated 7kW wall box all the more appealling. Use one of those and it’s slashed down to a much more convenient four hours. Public charging points will remain the quickest option, but be conscious that the quickest rate the e-Up recharges is 40kWh, so don’t waste time hunting out a fancy 150kWh charge point if there’s a 50kWh one free. The latter will work at the same speed. Using one of these will allow you to go from near-flat to 80% charged in around 40 minutes. Still longer than a petrol Up would take to refill, but handy enough if you’re caught short on a longer journey. Petrol-powered Ups have proved as reliable as they are popular over the years, with only a handful of recalls as outlined in that model’s separate review . However, none of those recalls have been specific to parts on the e-Up, reflecting that fully electric cars are often more reliable than ones with conventional engines, primarily because there are fewer parts to go wrong. With the newer, improved e-Up we’re not expecting any nasty surprises, either. The car itself is backed-up by VW’s usual three-year/60,000-mile warranty, while the battery pack itself is covered for eight years or 99,360 miles, whichever comes soonest.'\n"," 'There’s certainly no hint of the i800’s commercial vehicle background from behind the wheel. Although the steering column doesn’t adjust for reach, that matters little as it is easy to get a good driving position and it feels more car than people carrier. Build quality is excellent and most of the materials have an upmarket, tactile nature to them. Some of the less obvious plastics appear a little cheap but the clear dials, leather steering wheel and neat central controls make up for this. There’s also plenty of room, so like the rest of the cabin it feels spacious and comfortable while the view out is excellent thanks to the large windscreen. Thanks to a new suspension set-up the i800 rides very well so it’s extremely smooth, particularly on the motorway. On top of this all the seats are comfortable, even those in the third row and there’s plenty of legroom too – the middle row of chairs can be slid forward to boost knee space for those behind if needed plus both rear rows get independent ventilation and lighting controls too. Getting in and out couldn’t be easier thanks to the huge side doors – not only are they light and easy to slide, but they open wide to make access straightforward for both rows of seats.'\n"," ...\n"," 'The Karoq is capable of accommodating four adults in comfort, with good leg and shoulder room in the rear. There is space for a fifth passenger, but if you’ll frequently be using the middle rear seat then think about speccing the Varioflex seating system, which adds a larger centre seat and a three-way split-folding backrest for extra practicality. Standard on the Karoq SE L trim level, optional on the others, as well as affording a separate middle seat, the Varioflex layout also allows the rear seats to slide to create more luggage space. They are also designed to be removed altogether if you need maximum room. Just be aware that taking them out is still a convoluted process, and the seats are heavy. Another useful feature found on other Skodas that has made its way on to the Karoq is the fold-down picnic tables on the back of the front seats. The Karoq also boasts front door pockets capable of swallowing a 1.5-litre bottle of water, removable bins and some handy hooks in the bootspace. With the standard seats fitted there is 521 litres of luggage space with the rear seats in place, rising to 1,630 litres with them folded down. However, when fitted with the sliding Varioflex seats, rear-seats-up bootspace is anywhere between 479 litres to 588 litres depending on how far the seats are slid forward (they also tumble upwards), while maximum load space ranges from 1,605-1,810 litres, depending on whether you’re prepared to take those rear seats. You can’t have a variable height boot floor in conjunction with Varioflex rear seating, but hooks for shopping and a partition net are available. If you’re like us, it’s probably difficult to visualise what all those litre figures mean in real life. So perhaps the most important thing to know here is that the Karoq has a bigger boot than anything else in the class (next closest being the Peugeot 3008 ). The Varioflex gives it superior flexibility over most rivals as well. It is a particularly practical mid-size SUV. It might be an SUV but the Karoq really isn’t that tricky to park, with standard fit rear parking sensors and the option to add front parking sensors and a reversing camera. The steering is light at low speeds, the blindspots aren’t too intrusive and the driving position gives a decent view of the car’s extremities. If you tick the right option box automatic parking is also available, meaning you can simply pull up next to a space and have the car drive into it at the press of a button. The Skoda Karoq achieved a full five-star crash-test rating when it was rated by Euro NCAP at the end of 2017. That’s quite some time ago now, and the Euro NCAP regime has got tougher, but Skoda has also uprated the amount of available safety kit as part of the 2022 Karoq facelift. This should prove a very safe car. Enhancements here include the option of two additional rear side airbags as part of the Crew Protect Assist option – taking the total number that can be fitted to nine – and a new suite of advanced active safety systems called Travel Assist. So as well as autonomous emergency braking and all the active safety you’d ordinarily expect, the Karoq can be equipped with Predictive Cruise Control (which uses data from the navigation system as well as the car’s onboard camera) and Adaptive Lane Assist (which reacts to roadwork as well regular road markings), among many other features. There are also two standard Isofix mountings on the outer rear seats, plus an optional one on the front passenger seat. '\n"," 'There are two derivatives: the standard Boxster and the Boxster S. Each can be ordered with a six-speed manual gearbox, or the PDK seven-speed semi-automatic transmission that has paddleshifts behind the steering wheel. Both Boxsters have the Sport Plus button as standard and that allows the driver to choose between a sporty setting, or a comfort mode that is also better for fuel economy. In Sport mode you get a quicker throttle response and with the PDK transmission upshifts take place later and downshifts come earlier. The standard Boxster has a 261bhp 2.7-litre six-cylinder petrol engine under the bonnet. It’s 0.2 litres smaller than the predecessor but power is up by 13bhp. With more power and less weight, performance has been improved. The 0-62mph sprint takes 5.8 seconds with the six-speed manual, but in Sport Plus mode that falls to 5.7 seconds. With the PDK semi-automatic transmission the benchmark sprint is achieved in 5.5 seconds. Top speed is 164mph. Those are the stats, but what’s it like in practice? Well, power delivery on the standard Boxster is smooth, linear and uncompromising when you are in Sport mode and that’s where you need to leave it if you want to push the car a little bit. Normal mode is fine around town, but get it on a B-road and you’ll find yourself missing that extra oomph from the Sport setting. The standard Boxster is fast but it’s not brutal. Press the accelerator pedal and it’ll respond dutifully. There’s no unhealthy slug of power low down in the rev range, just a straightforward, unflustered burst of rapid acceleration. That’s because the maximum power output is reached at a heady 6,700rpm. The Boxster S, meanwhile, has the same 3.4-litre engine as before but power has been increased by 9bhp to give a total output of 311bhp, also achieved at 6,700rpm. It will get from 0-62mph in 5.1 seconds using the six-speed manual, 5.0 seconds flat with the help of Sport Plus and just 4.8 seconds with the PDK gearbox. Top speed is 173mph. The S is more urgent and it feels a handful when you are accelerating quickly. It’s not unwieldy though, and if outright performance is your priority you’ll not baulk at the extra cost needed to secure the S. Our pick would be the standard Boxster because it’s fast enough, and we think it is best with the PDK transmission. With this system you get smooth and quick gearchanges using the paddleshifts. Because the clutch pedal is quite firm in manual Boxsters, the PDK option is a must-have option if you live in an urban area. It’s pretty near perfect on the road. Blast into a corner and the nose will respond accordingly, and you get extra confidence because there’s shedloads of grip. The wider track means the Boxster is even more composed on twisty B-Roads and it’ll change direction quickly, with an almost dart-like feel. It’s extremely responsive, and although Porsche has introduced electromechanical steering, the sensations and feedback coming through the wheel are still strong. This gives you the feeling that you are at one with the car. It’s not quite as good as the previous car’s steering but it is very close and only the very keen drivers would be able to tell the difference. Brakes on both models are fantastic – even on slippery surfaces – allowing you to get to a standstill from speed without any fuss. You can shell out extra for the optional Sport Chrono package that helps you corner more quickly. You can also opt for Porsche’s Torque Vectoring system to increase the handling capabilities but we think that’s an unnecessary expense.'\n"," 'Practicality is one area where the e-2008 genuinely shines. In some cases, electric cars can have smaller boots (more so in plug-in hybrid cars) than their engine-driven counterparts, but the e-2008 boasts the same spacious interior and large boot as the regular 2008 – one of the more spacious small SUVs on the market. Consequently, four adults will fit comfortably thanks to generous rear space, with seat bases angled more than normal to create a bit more room for your legs. Long distance trips are a realistic proposition, as are load-heavy IKEA sessions. Headroom is generous once you’re in, but the roof is a little lower than in a Kona Electric or Niro EV . Up front, there’s plenty of space to stretch out, with the same clever storage areas to keep all your bits and bobs in place. In the boot, there’s 434 litres of space, which is exactly the same as the regular 2008. If you don’t need all that capacity, you can stick the two-level boot floor in its highest position. This means you don’t get a lip to load things over, and the seat backs are flush with the boot floor when you fold them down. The Peugeot e-2008 is based on the 208 supermini, which means there aren’t too many issues fitting into the all but the tightest of parking spaces. Rear three-quarter visibility over your shoulder is poor, and it’s difficult to judge the corners of the car. Mirrors are good, and all models get rear parking sensors with Allure adding front sensors and GT a rear-view camera. There are also a few options depending on your model. But in reality, the e-2008 will pose few issues, even when parking without using driver aids. The e-2008 is available with a wide range of driver assistance technology to keep you out of trouble on the move. Not all of it comes as standard, though, with lower-spec models doing without some key equipment. That means it gets a four-star Euro NCAP crash safety rating, while higher-spec models gain a full five stars. An adaptive cruise control system with a stop and go function is available, as well as lane-keep assist and a lane-positioning system to maintain position in the lane. These are part of the Drive Assist Plus package. There’s also automatic emergency braking , automatic parking, lane-departure warning, a driver alertness warning, automatic high-beam, blindspot monitoring and traffic sign recognition . All of this kit comes on higher-spec cars with a Safety Pack fitted, while lower-spec cars come with some (but not all) of it.

Car has low resale value as my experience does not appear to be unique.  So I have to chalk this up to a very expensive lesson.  While the car is disappointing the response of the dealership and Acura/Honda customer service was more  disappointing.  Acura buyer beware.  You are welcome to contact me and I can share the details of my experience and point you at my files and the videos of the problems I have had.Dave Pap Rocki, [contact info removed] There is a lot to like about this car, and frankly little to not like.  The only two gripes I have are (1) the low profile tires result in a ride that is busier than should be of a luxury car, and (2) at 6\\'1\", my head just barely misses hitting the headliner. I\\'m very happy with the performance, handling, ergonomics and fuel efficiency. The only major complaint I have is with the battery going dead when the car sits for more than 2 days. I suspect it\\'s a parasitic draw, possibly from the HFL module. Taking it back to the dealer and plan to leave it with them until they fix it. Apparently this is a problem with Acuras and I will not recommend buying this model, or any of the other ones, until they address it. Purchased my 2014 RLX in May 2014.  Other than the fact that the engine was kind of loud, and the car did not come with a spare tire of any kind, I was in love with my RLX the first time I drove it.  My favorite feature is the All Wheel Steering; I love the way the car handles.  What I don\\'t love is that something keeps draining the battery.  The first time my car failed to start was in Jan 2015, eight months after I purchased it.  This happened again in Sep 2015. The car was completely dead both times; wouldn\\'t make a sound.  I had to call Acura roadside assistance to jumpstart the car each time.  The car was taken to the dealership after each incident and they could not find what was causing the battery to drain, or any other problem with the vehicle.  I have also had problems with the touch screen going blank, Forward  Collision Warning activating for no reason,  the Bluetooth/phone screen not responding, and voice activation not working properly.  The Navigation system doesn\\'t work very well either, once you \"finally\" figure out how to use it.  I have had several problems trying to get the system to find addresses.  The search feature doesn\\'t do a good job of keying in on your current area for requested searches, not to mention, maps are outdated.  As much as I like the Acura RLX, It is unreliable, so I would not recommend it to a friend or anyone else for that matter. This car is alot better than reviewed from my perspective. I think the issue is this:This DOES NOT compete with the BMW 5 series or MB E-Class (regardless of what Acura would like)...really more like Lexus, Infiitniti or Lincoln based on my experience.That said, based on actual purchase price-- strong discount to MSRP/Invoice so well below BWM/MB this is a high quality, nice driving (love teh AWS) vehicle. My personal feeling is, while not flashy, the car is also sophisticated looking. So far I\\'m very pleased with the overall package I bought my RLX-ADV about 4 months ago and only put on about 1500 miles so far. I have already took it back three times for repair. There were iPhone 4S issue (automatic dial out and hang out), low battery and charging system warning sign(happened in less than first 50 miles), and camera too hot/LDW, LKAS shut down (90 degree outside) during driving. Dealer recharged the battery, but no action to other issues. Dealer and Acura insisted the shut down is the proper action by design. SF Bay Area is known for good climate. The LDW, LKAS shut-down happened multiple times in April. I really wonder what the car would do in Summer! Update on May 2016:Here are updates on the issues I reported. After two battery charging visits,, my dealer finally declared that it had a bad battery. I got a new battery in less than 12 months since owning the car. The charging issue was resolved. I do not have any phone issue now, either. It went away after I upgraded my phone to iPhone 6S. Honestly, this might be a problem of Apple, not Acura. However, the most important LDW & LKAS shut-down persists! It consistently shutting down these important safety features when outside temperature is around 90 degrees. I gave up fighting with Acura since they insisted this is a necessary precaution to protect the delicate electronic system. I am really disappointed. I spent extra money on this car since it was promised with these safety features. Acura sold me an ill-designed product that takes protection of car as priority over the driver!Update on May 2017:The LDW & LKAS shut-down is still a big problem! I have already experienced twice this year. Both times occurred when the temperature went up to low 90\\'s. I am an unsatisfied customer of Acura! I noticed rattles coming from front suspension after 500 miles. Brought it to the dealership and they couldn\\'t find anything wrong with it. Dealership reported service rep had the same problem but worse after 7k miles. After another 2k miles the rattles increased in frequency and loudness from all 4 wheels. Dealership replaced front struts which resolved a majority of the rattle but the rear rattle persisted. After another visit, the replaced the rear rattle. The rear is better but now the front is ever present over every bump. When I had a 2014RLX loaner the vehicle had the same issue as both mine and the service reps car. Cant believe engineering isn\\'t all over this issue. Beware of RLX. all in all, a very nice car. but not sure if i would lease it again given the opportunity Coming out of my first Acura a \\'12 TL AWD, I looked at everything else in its class. My wife got the \\'13 Lexus GS 350, which is very nice, but I needed more testosterone.I was very surprised when I test drove the RLX as most of the reviews by the \\'experts\\' were average at best.. It is a perfect fit for me. Bigger inside than my TL and the Lexus 350. Lots of room in the back seat. The control panel is much more intuitive than my TL. The ride is plenty smooth, the transmission feels great shifting in all gears, A/C is perfect. I really enjoy driving it. I leased it and did not know until I was handed the keys it comes with a great Roadside Assistance Pkg. basically covers everything.  Acura plays by no one elses rules as far as I can tell.Every competitors car that Acura claims the Acura RLX competes with is either rear wheel drive or all wheel drive.The RLX is front wheel drive with Rear Wheel Precision Steer.Initial marketing reasons would conclude its silly for Acura to say they compete with those other cars, but the truth is when you drive the RLX and feel how wonderfully precise it is and how nice the drive is you have to ask yourself why would I want all wheel drive with more things to break and horrible fuel economy.I have had my RLX now for 1000+ miles and I love it.The more I drive it the more I love it.I have owned Lexus LS430, ES300h, BMW...  I just traded my 2009 RL for a 2014 RLX w Navigation.I cannot get over the step backwards in features and quality.The interior could just as easily be for a Corolla.The Radio is inferior to the standard model in 2009.As best as I can tell the only additional feature on the RLX is the X!After a week, I wish I had just stayed with my 2009.I suggest that you stay away feom any of the RLX models except the Advanced package if you don;t mind paying its sky high price.Honda should be ashamed of itself for calling this a luxury car.A loaded Civic would come closer. Just bought 2014 rlx advance, had 2011 rlthe difference is like night and day.WOW! what a great car , we love it.rlx does it all , great ride, tech is state of the art.looks great.jg Great car only thing i did not like was trade in value on my last car. Comfortable, great handling ,powerful ,reliable,great gas mileage! This car is a understated value, Had a BMW prior to buying this car. This car is a lot quieter, rides better/smoother, has better visibility, and interior materials. The BMW hype is just that! I love this Acura RLX Advanced. I test drove just about every luxury sedan in this price range--BMW, Audi, Lexus, Infinity, Porsche (suv), and some midlevel sedans as well, and I can honestly say this is the best one out there.  Why?  Well,....it depends on what you want.  I wanted Quality (I\\'ve always loved the way Acura\\'s drive and last), Safety (NHTSA and IIS best ratings --with suite of safety features), Visibility (you can actually see out of the car and over your shoulder), Dependability (not one issue with it for over a year),  and Ease of Driving (the smoothest engine and most maneuverability I\\'ve come across), ---(btw, the steering IS very connected to the road and incredibly sporty for a large sedan).  Not to mention--- the roomy, rear seat, , the quiet cabin, the improved suspension, the way it climbs a hill and never downshifts, not to mention its\\' classic, elegant appearance.  The RLX is a fantastic vehicle and it\\'s a shame that it doesn\\'t get more love in the press.  Read reviews from actual owners!!  Test drive it yourself, and you\\'ll be extremely surprised in the best possible way.  Pricing is high, but check around to get a good deal.  They are out there.  There is nothing sedate about this top notch sedan.  It is thee hidden jewel at Acura! Traded in a 2012 Acura TL .  The 2017 Acura RLX is just a perfect Car.  It is quiet has a lot of power and a great car for the price.  Tested a Lexus GS350 but the Acura RLX is much better. By far the best car i have every owned. Does all the bells and whistles in outstanding manner. Cons a bit pricey for most folks. I was looking for a car that would provide some relief to a 52 mile round trip daily commute to work on very congested interstate (I-35 in Texas).  I wanted a car that had good performance, fuel economy, and semi-autonomous driving features.  I looked at BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac, and Acura.  I choose the Acura RLX Hybrid because of Traffic Jam Assist, good fuel economy, and fantastic acceleration.  I have had the car two months and have put on over 3,000 miles in that time.  So far, I average 30 mpg.  Occasionally, I put the car in Sport mode, but I usually leave it in the standard drive mode.  In both modes, the car has very good acceleration; however, if you want the best acceleration put it in Sport mode.  I use Traffic Jam Assist daily.  It works best if you get in a freeway lane that does not have a lot of cars trying to merge in.  The system sometimes is slow to respond to a car that darts in front of you.  I have used the TJA to drive all the way from south Austin to north San Antonio and had to take control only once or twice.  I highly recommend this car.  I recommend that you ensure you are ok with the infotainment system and that you are fine with the small trunk before you buy. Entertainment system may not be intuitive or showy but it works really well when you get used to it and the sound is awesome! Same for navigation - not showy but it does the job. The driving aids (lane keeping etc.) and ride are outstanding, and it is fast when you want it to be. Excellent value but I bought it because I liked it better than the Audi S5 I was considering. Great car for mid-west mixed driving. Way under-rated model. If you are looking for well built and luxury car, this is it. I got this car back in April 2015. I have 9k miles on it now. Car drives without any issues whatsoever. When driving around 70 miles on the freeway car gets about 34mpg, even though by the book it is 31mpg. Mixed driving I get 26-27mpg, which is great considering how big car is. Car is definitely not the softest on the planet, since I saw few people complain about it, which is true I agree with that, however car is luxury/sport and some sport cars are not the most soft cars out-there. I really like a lot of standard options such as LED Headlights, P-AWS rear wheel steering technology 19\" luxury wheels, acoustic windshield and front glass and etc., This car is definitely worth getting considering car cost a lot less than competition with similar options, less by about 15k. Also retail value always nice on Acuras and reliability is good if you think to keep car for longer than 5 years. In my opinion car looks much better than Lexus GS and boring looking Audi A6. Acura looks very beautiful, one of my favorite looking car in it\\'s class. One of my requirements was 4 Wheel or All Wheel Drive capability in a luxury sedan.  This car was wonderful but didn\\'t have either although, as I understand it, prior models did. Just to give a little backround, my last two cars were a Lexus GS and an Acura RL.  I did not like my Lexus at all and got rid of it after less than two years.  I had that Lexus in the shop 7 times in those two years for various problems.  Up until then, I had pretty much owned only Toyota or Lexus.  In 2008, I decided to get the Acura RL to replace the Lexus GS.  The Acura RL treated me very well for 6 years until I gave it to my daughter.  When it was time to get a new car, I considered many different luxury brands but kept coming back to Acura.  So far, I have 24,000 miles on the car.  I can honestly say, this is the best car I have ever owned.  I look forward to driving it everyday.  There were a couple of recalls which were easily taken care of...I was not having problems before the recalls.  If I had to do it again, I would not hesitate to get the RLX.  I would love to have the hybrid version but it was not available when I bought my car.  I had a deposit for one with the dealer but after waiting a year, they finally told me they weren\\'t sure when they would available.  I guess that would be my one complaint with Acura...they had a predicted release date for the hybrid and it kept getting delayed and there was no information available as to if and when they were going to come out with the car. Quality of interior is mediocre. ^-cylinder shifting is annoyingly rough; wife\\'s 12 year old Subaru smoother. Purchased new RLX in 2014, what a mistake.  It has had three recalls and now an engine noise has developed which Acura mechanics can not figure out.  Audio tapes have been sent to Acura Engineering and they are stumped.  I intend to get rid of it as soon as it comes back from shop (two weeks)   Bad news trade in value is now $35,000 for a one year old car with 12,000 miles for which I paid $52,000.  Go with Lexus or Infinity and save yourself trouble This is a wonderful car- my 4th Acura (2 TSX, 1 TL) Interior surpasses anything I looked at and the technology that comes standard is exceptional.  Could be a bit sharper on the outside but still gets lots of looks and certainly beats the Lexus GS. And, with the great discounting going on, would be hard to beat the value. This is a very underrated car. I just ordered my second RLX after finishing a three-year lease. Initially, I was quite surprised at how much I liked this car.   It has comfort, value, a killer stereo, reliability, and quality materials throughout.  Unfortunately, Acura has chosen not to aggressively market this model. That\\'s too bad, because it\\'s a real jewel! First, any \"Expert\" that is paid to write an article about a car should have to drive one of the cars for a month, then write their opinion. This clown who was an independent writer for Forbes, says the 2016 Acura RLX is one of the worst 10 cars to buy. Seriously? A 5 Star safety rating in every category, phenomenal company (Acura makes a lemon?) incredibly smooth, quiet, has great acceleration, is sexy, sleek, but doesn\\'t have the perception as a racecar like a BMW ( had one, and it sucked, unless you LIKE being in the repair shop all the time), so it gets hammered before it is even proven?  This Acura RLX is  so fun to drive, whether a short jaunt or a multiple hour trip, it is outstanding in spite of what a non-owner tries to tell you. Expect to but it $10K under MSRP. The technology package is nice, the visibility is great, and I\\'d rather have a DEPENDABLE, SAFE car like this than a slightly faster BMW that will break down, or Mercedes (Turbo charged 4 cylinders are stupid if you want a car long-term) sedan unless you buy 500. Acura has a reputation as dependable and reliable, and this is still true. We bought this car about a month ago and it was certainly the most expensive car we\\'ve ever purchased.  We did wind up test driving basically every car at the Acura dealership as well as checked out comprable Lexus sedans as well as the Accord (our historical default choice).  Now that we\\'ve driven the car for about 5 weeks, our intial impression: its fantastic!  I deliberately left the \"value\" category blank as its certainly in a very different class than other cars we\\'ve purchased in the past. (Frankly we\\'d consider that the Accord is a great \"value\".)   Thus far, we\\'ve been thrilled with the RLX Hybrid.  Its comfortable for long and short rides, quite sporty and, when driven a bit aggressively/sport mode, will certainly demand the driver\\'s attention to keep the shiny side up.  The safety features are amazing (CMBS,LKAS, etc).  The safety features as well as the tech features did require some a bit of study, but now I find it very intuitive.  Overall an outstanig car! Overall very satisfied with this purchase.  Currently at 14k miles.  No major glitches.  Controls are intuitive and easy to master.   However, Playing XM stations are glitchy and very slow to load, for scrolling;  as are obtaining music from your USB FlashDrive.  Push Button shifting, especially reverse, is slow to engage (1 sec) on press of accelerator.  Hybrid system is absolutely awesome, but comes with sacrifice of trunk space.  Engine is very quiet when switching between electric motors and engine running; transfers between each completely unnoticed except for the RPM needle moving, ......this hybrid is much different than those gas saving German models which \"die\" at a stop sign, then restart.  Very comfortable and rides well.  Power distribution lives up to the \"rides on rails\"  marketing motto.  Would definitely buy again, and recommend. comes time to replace this car.  I really like this car, and they just do not make them any more! I love this car its my first car gets around well needs  window tint kinda wish I got the type s so could learn how to drive a manual system but it works great its small just right for a sports car I wanna modify it soon it may be an older car but its also my first but the car was worth it its great on gas and never has any problems for me. I bought this car used only to have problems with it since the day i bought it. First when i got my first tire rotation the stud broke it wasn\\'t a big deal then water kept getting into my tail light and the dealer said it had a bad seal. After that the struts went bad. Then finally around 40,000 miles the motor had a catastrophic failure. A rod bent causing two 3\" holes in the block and basically they said it needed a new motor which would cost 10,000 dollars to install. And since the dealer could not find what caused it they said the warranty would not cover it. So i just simply let them have the car back bc i wasn\\'t paying for a piece of junk car. I was pleasantly surprised by the cars handling and performance.  It\\'s a 5 speed Tiptronic automatic with a 2.0 L4 Vtec engine.  The car also handles great and easy to make lane changes.  Since the car is pretty light, it doesn\\'t need a huge displacement engine to make it go fast, although a turbo would be nice aftermarket upgrade for those who had the type-s model.  I don\\'t usually like 4 cylinder engines, but this one is quite a bit larger than most (Most are 1.6 L).  It\\'s also quite a bit torquey for one as well (can get it to squeal on brisk acceleration).  The \\'05/\\'06 Models have the upgraded lighting and wheels which give it more of a luxurious look then previous years. Just bought an \\'06 RSX on a lease return.  Great condition and lots of fun to drive on my 8-mile commute on a bendy highway, but it lacks some pretty basic features like a remote hatch release.  I\\'ve owned Hondas exclusively since I turned 16 and each one, even my old \\'83 Accord SE, had a lever to pop the trunk from the driver\\'s seat.  The plastic sun visors feel cheap, and there\\'s not as much storage for odds and ends as I\\'d like.  Overall, I prefer the interior of my previous \\'98 Accord EX coupe for features but the leather seats offer great support and comfort in the turns.  Engine and performance in the RSX blow the Accord away.  Better mileage and acceleration? Well worth the price. This car is great, pretty fast for a 2.0L inline four. Quick on the acceleration and grabs corners like a magnet, rides smooth even over very deep pot holes and high speed bumps. At top speed is pretty smooth and stable along with shifting the whole way, pretty good for a 5M base but there\\'s always aftermarket for those days when you wanna get up and go. Did lack a couple of interior options and design for an Acura but still being a sports car, it\\'s awesome. I would recommend for any driver, guess thats why after I bought mine, I now know 5 people who recently bought one as well. Can\\'t go wrong with a Honda. I live in New York City and as an everyday commuter sitting in heavy traffic, the automatic makes perfect sense. It is a great looking car and very comfortable for 2 people. The handling is excellent and the sequential sportshift 5 speed is tons of fun. It is a little underpowered but that is why there is a Type-S. I upgraded to the 17 inch wheels from the type-s for better handling. The stock 16s lack style in my opinion.  This car is great for a first sports car. It has plenty of power and handling. This thing takes turns beautifully. Shifting is smooth. There is also a lot of aftermarket parts for it.  One of the most fun vehicles to drive. Bought new from dealership in February \\'07. Excellent gas mileage, 90 percent highway miles. I recently walked away from a very serious accident with only 2 minor scratches. The safety features in this car saved my life. Wish this car was still being produced, would buy again without hesitation.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":33}],"source":["BBB = cached_customer_reviews_instance.retreive_customer_reviews()\n","CCC = \"\"\n","for i in range(0,40):\n","  CCC = CCC + BBB.loc[i, \"review_body\"]\n","CCC"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":34,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1442,"status":"ok","timestamp":1711021775696,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Zhvanskiy","userId":"11978303123960557609"},"user_tz":0},"id":"5HksaENEPcei","outputId":"4f774eec-7664-45a0-905b-5c06c787173f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["loading pretrained classification model from file = \n","/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CarRecommendationEngine_classifySentences/data/trained_classification_models/trained_pipeline_0.pkl\n","loading pretrained classification model from file = \n","/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CarRecommendationEngine_classifySentences/data/trained_classification_models/trained_pipeline_1.pkl\n","loading pretrained classification model from file = \n","/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CarRecommendationEngine_classifySentences/data/trained_classification_models/trained_pipeline_2.pkl\n","loading pretrained classification model from file = \n","/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CarRecommendationEngine_classifySentences/data/trained_classification_models/trained_pipeline_3.pkl\n","loading pretrained classification model from file = \n","/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CarRecommendationEngine_classifySentences/data/trained_classification_models/trained_pipeline_4.pkl\n","loading pretrained classification model from file = \n","/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CarRecommendationEngine_classifySentences/data/trained_classification_models/trained_pipeline_5.pkl\n","loading pretrained classification model from file = \n","/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CarRecommendationEngine_classifySentences/data/trained_classification_models/trained_pipeline_6.pkl\n","loading pretrained classification model from file = \n","/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CarRecommendationEngine_classifySentences/data/trained_classification_models/trained_pipeline_7.pkl\n","loading pretrained classification model from file = \n","/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CarRecommendationEngine_classifySentences/data/trained_classification_models/trained_pipeline_8.pkl\n","loading pretrained classification model from file = \n","/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CarRecommendationEngine_classifySentences/data/trained_classification_models/trained_pipeline_9.pkl\n","loading pretrained classification model from file = \n","/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CarRecommendationEngine_classifySentences/data/trained_classification_models/trained_pipeline_10.pkl\n","loading pretrained classification model from file = \n","/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CarRecommendationEngine_classifySentences/data/trained_classification_models/trained_pipeline_11.pkl\n","loading pretrained classification model from file = \n","/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CarRecommendationEngine_classifySentences/data/trained_classification_models/trained_pipeline_12.pkl\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-30-4e8f8a473010>:46: FutureWarning: The frame.append method is deprecated and will be removed from pandas in a future version.

Car has low resale value as my experience does not appear to be unique. While the car is disappointing the response of the dealership and Acura/Honda customer service was more  disappointing. Apparently this is a problem with Acuras and I will not recommend buying this model, or any of the other ones, until they address it. Other than the fact that the engine was kind of loud, and the car did not come with a spare tire of any kind, I was in love with my RLX the first time I drove it. The first time my car failed to start was in Jan 2015, eight months after I purchased it. The car was taken to the dealership after each incident and they could not find what was causing the battery to drain, or any other problem with the vehicle. So far I\\'m very pleased with the overall package I bought my RLX-ADV about 4 months ago and only put on about 1500 miles so far. There were iPhone 4S issue (automatic dial out and hang out), low battery and charging system warning sign(happened in less than first 50 miles), and camera too hot/LDW, LKAS shut down (90 degree outside) during driving. Honestly, this might be a problem of Apple, not Acura. I have already experienced twice this year. Dealership reported service rep had the same problem but worse after 7k miles. When I had a 2014RLX loaner the vehicle had the same issue as both mine and the service reps car. My wife got the \\'13 Lexus GS 350, which is very nice, but I needed more testosterone.I was very surprised when I test drove the RLX as most of the reviews by the \\'experts\\' were average at best.. This car is a understated value, Had a BMW prior to buying this car. I test drove just about every luxury sedan in this price range--BMW, Audi, Lexus, Infinity, Porsche (suv), and some midlevel sedans as well, and I can honestly say this is the best one out there. I wanted a car that had good performance, fuel economy, and semi-autonomous driving features. I choose the Acura RLX Hybrid because of Traffic Jam Assist, good fuel economy, and fantastic acceleration. So far, I average 30 mpg. When driving around 70 miles on the freeway car gets about 34mpg, even though by the book it is 31mpg. Mixed driving I get 26-27mpg, which is great considering how big car is. Also retail value always nice on Acuras and reliability is good if you think to keep car for longer than 5 years. I had that Lexus in the shop 7 times in those two years for various problems. The Acura RL treated me very well for 6 years until I gave it to my daughter. So far, I have 24,000 miles on the car. There were a couple of recalls which were easily taken care of...I was not having problems before the recalls. I had a deposit for one with the dealer but after waiting a year, they finally told me they weren\\'t sure when they would available. I intend to get rid of it as soon as it comes back from shop (two weeks)   Bad news trade in value is now $35,000 for a one year old car with 12,000 miles for which I paid $52,000. It has comfort, value, a killer stereo, reliability, and quality materials throughout. Acura has a reputation as dependable and reliable, and this is still true. We bought this car about a month ago and it was certainly the most expensive car we\\'ve ever purchased. I deliberately left the \"value\" category blank as its certainly in a very different class than other cars we\\'ve purchased in the past. Engine is very quiet when switching between electric motors and engine running; transfers between each completely unnoticed except for the RPM needle moving, ......this hybrid is much different than those gas saving German models which \"die\" at a stop sign, then restart. I love this car its my first car gets around well needs  window tint kinda wish I got the type s so could learn how to drive a manual system but it works great its small just right for a sports car I wanna modify it soon it may be an older car but its also my first but the car was worth it its great on gas and never has any problems for me. I bought this car used only to have problems with it since the day i bought it. Then finally around 40,000 miles the motor had a catastrophic failure. A rod bent causing two 3\" holes in the block and basically they said it needed a new motor which would cost 10,000 dollars to install. And since the dealer could not find what caused it they said the warranty would not cover it.

Safest car I've ever own..  Over 1/2 the cars we've owned have been Volvo...This one will change that. This has had constant noise in the form of clunks, squeals and rattles. There is always an error light or message on and we've spent a small fortune on parts. I'm a certified ASE mechanic and do all my own work but this has been a challenge. New rack and pinion, new exhaust, new struts, new springs, new tie rod ends, new radiator, new pulleys and new tires every 15K. This thing cant keep tires or brakes! The gas mileage is great, the power wonderful but everything else failed. The stereo is substandard and no one will touch it for aftermarket because of Volvos proprietary computers. The mirror trim has fallen off, the light dimmer/turn signal indicator fell off, windows get stuck. In short, this has left my wife stranded more then any vehicle she's owned. Tried to talk with dealership about issues but they create even more...worst dealer we've ever worked with. Tried to talk with Volvo and they didn't care. You can get a lemon but when the dealer and the manufacture wont help and in fact, exasperate the situation, it tells you it's time to move on. We're shopping for two new vehicles and wouldn't consider owning another Volvo. We actually bought a 2012 BMW X3. It's the best vehicle I've ever owned. Customer support is off the charts compared to Volvo and the vehicle arnt even in the same league! I'm angry at myself for waiting so long to get rid of Volvo...you really can enjoy your SUV.  My XC-90 is horrible, front to back.Friends don\\u0092t let friends buy volvo\\u0092s. Treatment from the volvo dealerships in Houston is horrible, unless you are super rich, they will certainly hook you up, otherwise, bring your checkbook.You pay out the nose to own a volvo. My xc-90? 3 sets of wheel bearings burned out, the rear end went out, the fuel pump has already been replaced, the CURRENT check engine light issue will cost me $1,000, just put $1,500 into it to get the steering column to work again, the Houston dealership seriously jacked me over. you HAVE to take it to the dealership. They know they've got you by the throat. OBTW, my windshield leaks. Headlights fogged from inside. $500 each.  Purchased a used 2006 Volvo XC90 AWD V8 a year ago, had 77K miles on it, but was in excellent condition and we thought very safe for our family.We didn't know it had a transmission that COULD NOT be repaired ONLY REPLACED.The Volvo dealership informed us that this particular transmission was not repairable.Unfortunately our warranty company wouldn't ok the replacement so we had to transfer the car to a transmission repair facility to try and rebuild it.They were able to get all the parts needed but 1 and Volvo wouldn't sell the 1 part that would fix our car.SO we had to purchase a USED transmission for $5,700.00 (new would have been $7,500)..  We purchased my Volvo used in 2007 and it had 36,000 miles on it.  We had recently had our second child and loved the safety features and quality of this car.  (Not to mention it is beautiful) It came with a few flaws, poor fuel consumption and rear doors that don't open wide enough in the back to get kids/groceries misc in and out.  Third row is a joke really, no room for normal sized adults.  Ok for children but hard to get them in and out.  Overall this vehicle made me happy for 3 years and we never had any repairs other than scheduled maintenance.  Just traded it in on a minivan due to our THIRD child arriving, but still missing my Volvo.  I'll have another one again someday..  110k mi & still drives fantastic! Smooth, powerful, tight handling & fun to drive. Happy with whole drivetrain.  Only problem so far was the \\\"infotainment software bug,\\\" which was fixed with quick update @ dealer.  DON'T get turbo model with \\\"garbage\\\" GM transmission. The V8's avg 1mpg gas penalty is worth every drop!  '05+ Yamaha V8 model has better Aisan Warner 6-speed & nice AWD system.  Did i mention the significant testicular fortitude?.  I bought this car used in Nov of 2008 and have had it for almost a year and a half.  I have not had one problem with this car.  I am very pleased with the performance.  The gas mileage could be better but i knew that going in.  The interior does not have enough space for all my stuff but I manage.  I really love driving this car and feel very safe in it. .  We've had the XC90 since Dec. 05 and have only performed scheduled maintenance. Comfort, safety, and reliability have been excellent. .  Got this car for thousands off because I bought it in 2007 when it was a 2006 model, but it was new. Very happy with the looks outside and inside. After a 5 months I had some problems, some anti-skid message that kept coming up, they said it was a computer problem but it happened twice. Possibly due to extremely horrible speed bumps where I live the car began making weird clicks when the gas/brakes were pressed; brake pads, alignment, sub-frame, etc all needed work. Right window makes whistling noise. DVD system headphones sound fuzzy sometimes. Very fast for an SUV, and I always feel safe..  I've had my '06 for 16 months now but before that had an 05.  Just test drove an ML 350 from Mercedes and I must say I prefer my Volvo. Granted the ML had a few features that were nice but overall, my Volvo had much more comfortable seats and more features for the price, i.e. dvd system, memory driver's seat, etc. I also have much more cargo area in my Volvo and because it's a bigger car I have more legroom and just feel safer. Close the doors on the Mercedes and do the same with the Volvo and you'll know the difference. My only gripe so far with the Volvo is the cheaply made stereo speaker units in the front corners. Should be better for a 50K+ vehicle..  An excellent car, firm ride.  You have the feeling of being in a safe car.  Goes through snow with ease. Very good handling.  I recommend this car to anyone who wants a safe car.  Gas mileage is a bit off and the gas tank is relatively small for a car of this size..  I love the ride but it has died in the middle of a busy intersection twice. It had to be towed back to the dealership and they replaced the fuel pump and we are waiting to see what they think it is this time. The driver's side beam has had to be replaced twice. The DVD system works intermittently. I thought Volvos were supposed to be dependable and safe. I have a 3 year old and I am going to have to get something else unfortunately..  Purchased a 2003 XC90 T6 new. Traded it in for a XC90 V8 in 2006. Totally different vehicle. Engine powerful and quiet.  No comparison with the T6.  T6 noisy, rough running and a gas hog.  V8 smooth as silk and much better MPG. Also, the T6 was a five passenger, the V8 a 7.  The V8 rides much smoother because of the self leveling rear. All in all a world class vehicle with a top IIHS safety rating. You can spend a lot more money on an SUV and I don't think you can buy a much better vehicle.  Dollar for dollar an excellent investment.  .  I have had my XC90 for just over a year now.  It's the best vehicle I've ever owned but has some small drawbacks that I can overlook. The driver seat is already starting to feel as if it is wearing on the outer bolster.  Overall it handles great for its size and does better than great on the autobahn in Germany at speed.  The 6-speed tip-tronic changes are somewhat slushy during gear changes.  I still compare it to the Touareg and LR3 that my co-workers have and I find it to be a better vehicle than theirs.  Some of the options could come down in price.  Over $3k for navigation is too much.  I bought an aftermarket system for less than $600.  But you pay quality money for a quality SUV..  From the delivery from Neftin Volvo ( awesome dealership) the XC90 has been my favorite car ever.  Rides like a magic carpet and off roads like rhino.  I LOVE IT!.  I waited 2 yrs for this car!  Needed the suv body style,  very happy with this!  A few minor problems (computer errors).  At 25,000 miles, had to replace tires.  Not happy about that. Was told its common on Awd suvs?!  Would like to know what other owners think about this.  .  I replaced a BMW X3 with this car. As I wanted a little more room, I compared it to the 2006 BMW X5. The ORE is a better value.  Hesitant about the V-8, but average mileage is 20.0 mpg in mixed driving.  My 2.5L X3 averaged 22 mpg.  I gave up 2 mpg for an extra 125 h.p., a smoother ride and more room -an excellent trade off.  Excellent storage and cargo space. Very quiet ride. .  I purchased the Volvo XC90 V8 due to the safety and convenience features.  I have nothing but problems with the SUV.  It stalls and is a hazard.  Upon checking the internet, there are many purchasers that have had problems with the Volvo XC90.  Next time I will stick to Toyota/Lexus.  This Volvo is a headache.  By the way, this is supposed to be my wife's SUV.  She is 7 months pregnant.  She will not be driving this vehicle!  Another issue is the towing capacity.  It is rated at 5000 pounds.  This is with the driver only.  Any passengers and cargo decreases this capacity rapidly.  Also, it requires a transmission cooler and brake controller.  The dealers won't install them..  Last vehicle was a 2004 Acura MDX. The XC90 has a better, with the V8, engine and transmission. Very comfortable with most of the controls in a good position. Only have 700 miles but have been averaging 19 mpg. Only driven it in the rain but the handling, while not sporty, is good. If you want a good overall SUV, this should be high on your list. Any BMW X5 will offer better handling and performance but doesn't have the cargo space..  solid, safe and with surprising performance. did 20.6 mpg on an interstate trip of 800 miles [doing a steady 80]..  Very impressive for a SUV - sturdy, good power, nice drive.  Quality interior & overall design - unmatched safety..  Before going for the XC90 V8, I drove the Porsche Cayanne S, Lexus GX470, Lexus LX470 and Acura MDX, Whiule the other SUV's had a lot more bells and whistles (voice activated Navigation/Bluetooth, etc.), this SUV had the best performance, look, feel and room of the bunch, for the price. I love the power, the cabin is very nicely appointed. Everything is logically laid out and performs perfectly. I added the Bluetooth system, which works great with our phones. This is my third SUV and I am completely sold on Volvos after driving this one..  This SUV rides like a sedan.  The Yamaha V8 gives it plenty of power. I can't say enough good things about it.  The roomy interior has a clean, elegant look to it and the stereo is excellent and powerful.  Considering the projected resale value (best in class) You should not hesitate to buy one. .  After much dreaming and waiting for a VOLVO SUV, the XC90 does not disappoint. It's a comfortable, safe people mover that gives everybody a great ride (3rd row seats are higher for better views). The V8/6-speeds are mated nicely (purrs well!). Good snow traction and power here in the Rockies and for the highways on OE all-season tires (special winter tires were not needed). Love the split rear hatch and easy access throughout. Beautiful looking vehicle, great lines and finish. A solid and well built machine. Well designed and thoughtful interior. Easy to read dials and settings (although the radio is a bit clunky to set). We're going to get the Bluetooth installed next month. Great SUV. \",\n          \" Solid vehicle, no major repairs in 7 years of ownership, mileage isn\\u2019t a plus, but excellent overall value otherwise..  The car is great and is very roomy for a sedan. It doesn't get great gas mileage when traveling in the city, but it is comfortable. I wish the A/C vents had a switch to turn them off. A big complaint is that in order to replace the headlights, you need to take it to a dealership or car repair shop, because the whole front bumper needs to be taken off to access the headlights. Other than the dumb design of that, I really love the car!.  Be sure to look around any buy the one you want, some Malibus from this generation have different features than others like remote start, sun roof, color options, etc. Be sure to shop around and buy what you want! This car is awesome on long highway trips! Very comfortable and great gas mileage!.  Great car to save money on gas and use for long trips..  Unless you enjoy dropping hundreds-thousands of dollars on repairs every couple of months do not buy this car! As soon as it\\u2019s warranty expires it starts falling apart. Not to mention it\\u2019s nearly impossible to work on it yourself as GM specially designed it to require special tools and equipment to fix. Even simple problems like a broken speaker turn costly fast. I\\u2019ve already replaced the transmission, had to replace all 4 brakes multiple times, had the body control module \\u201crepaired\\u201d under a recall (which started going bad again a couple years later and no, they won\\u2019t fix it again), the cruise control won\\u2019t always disengage when you press the brakes (scarey!!!), the brake lights only work sometimes, the speakers only work sometimes, and the list only goes on from there. At this point I am trying to wash my hands of this piece of garbage by selling it and getting a little bit of money back, it\\u2019s only been able to go about 1-3 weeks at a before something else brakes so I have to keep sticking money into it so I can even sell it. I am also learning the hard way how fast these cars depreciate. My car is only 6 years old and sold for around $25,000 new and is now worth about $7,000, a little over half of what I paid a few years ago. That\\u2019s with only 94,000 miles and no rust, dents, or scratches. I wouldn\\u2019t tak another Chevy or even GM vehicle of someone paid me..  Wonky transmission, poor paint quality, and overall drabness drove me to switch to an Asian-made vehicle for the first time in my life..  Don't buy this car. I got this for a good deal in 2013, at the time the car was 2 years old and had less then 40k miles on it. Should have got the extended warranty because the transmission gave out entirely last year after just 95k miles (!!). It cost $3500 to replace, which is likely more than the car was worth. Lots of little problems every service, easily costing me thousands over the last four years. This despite me taking it to the dealer for service every six months and following all recommended procedures. The mileage is quite poor, and the car is does not accelerate as quickly as one would hope. Also, if the headlamps go out, you have to remove the front bumper just to change it (pathetic design - really hope that GM engineer was fired). So what should be a $20 fix is instead $150 with the labor charges. The only upside to this car is the storage room and legroom, which are both quite good. But otherwise it is no-frills, and pretty poor build quality. I would not recommend this car to anyone..  This was the least comfortable car I have ever owned. The seats were hard and the seams cut into the lower back and tail bone. The interior cabin was noisy and we could hear all the road noise and feel every road bump.  We traded it in after about 7 months and LOST over 12,000 in resale value!  I would not recommend this car to my worst enemy!.  If you by used dealers charge way more than its worth. Motor troubles at 70000 even if you maintain. Buy it out right do not finance otherwise make sure you have at leat 5000 stocked away for car emergencies. Make sure you get a good warranty dont go with C.A.R.S PLUS PROTECTION they dont cover much. This car will give you financial blues . Brake sysytem too sensors are no if good. If you have children steer clear!!!!!.  Two days after buying it I had to put it in the shop a bunch of recalls feel unsafe to drive and transport my kids in.  For the few years between carting kids to practice then college in a mini-van I had a sports car.  THEN my kids had kids :-) and I needed a car that could hold up to three car seats / booster seats depending on grandkids in the back seat.  There is room and the back seat is a \\\"flat\\\" bench with pre-installed hooks for carseats.  Hook to the frame on both sides of the bottom, hook to the frame behind headrest and seats were appropriately installed and *I* did it!  Easy in and out as I also transport my elderly parents in the car.  Both front and back doors open wide (be sure passengers know that lest the next car get dinged) and I can have Mom put both legs out and on the ground, she holds the bracket and my hand and up we go.  I regret that I don't have leather seats, which I've always had.  However, the upholstery is of good quality and cleans with a babywipe.  I'm picky about dust, etc, and it looks great just driving through a carwash.  The computer in the car is so accurate I know when tire pressure needs attention, mpg readout is accurate, oil life.  Poor quality inside and out, with a lot of plastic.  However, it's a comfortable and quiet car that's easy to drive in any weather..  .  This car is AWESOME. FUN TO DRIVE SUPER SAFE AND RELIABLE I HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT!!.  What a mistake this piece of junk is. There are countless recalls and they are all on insignificant things. Do yourself a favor and google \\\"2011 Chevy Malibu Engine Power Decreased\\\" and read the reviews about this POS. There is no recall for a problem that costs not only $2,000 TO FIX, but can be deadly. Long story short, there is a faulty sensor that goes out somewhere between 50,000-120,000 miles (roll of the dice) that is going to without warning make your car shake and reduce your engine power. There are stories about people on the freeway that had this happen while driving and their car dropped to 25 miles per hour.Go in to get it fixed, $2,000 to replace the damage this stupid sensor has caused. Don't buy this car. Ever. For any reason. Until there is a full recall don't touch it..  I can't say enough good things about this car!  It runs super quiet, has great pick up and passing power, rides smooth, gets great gas mileage (27/mpg combined for me with 50/50 city/highway), looks sharp and has awesome audio system. I'm thinking of buying another one right one for one of my teenagers. It's been a while since we've owned a domestic car but the 2011 Malibu has changed our minds - we're a Chevy family now!!.  I have bought GM products starting with a 1967 Camaro through even a Chevy Vega and continuing to the present up to and including the aforementioned 2011 Malibu.  My guess is that I have purchased over the years about 20 GM products, so this comment does not come from a closet Ford or Dodge owner.  At 120,000 miles the transmission just quit.  Everyone I know who owns something other than a GM product have in excess of  that with no problem.  I try to be loyal to not only the brand but the dealership.  Basically, I was told by the dealer here in Idaho that your car is worth nothing and a transmission will cost you $3,500.  So the car is at the dealership and I have had to borrow cars to get around.  Your alternatives are few short of putting a for sale sign on the car and parking it at the dealership.  There was no effort to try to ameliorate the frustration by either the company or the dealership.  I will put in  the transmission, but I will not return to Chevrolet or the dealership.  The lesson to be learned  from this to always get the cheapest price as there is no advantage to being loyal to a brand or a dealer.  The travails continued after I picked up the car,with new transmission, it sounded awful when it started lots of valve clatter and before I got out of the parking lot the check engine light came on.  On Star diagnostics said it needed to go back to the dealer.  After having it for at least two weeks and paying them $3,500 the car was not running.  The service manager was busy explaining it was not his fault and I was busy thinking that is a load of crap.  To say I was angry and disappointed would be an under statement.  He said it would take 40 minutes to change the now defective sensor; he was back in less than 5.  Clearly they failed to make all the proper connections and it was just a question of correcting that.  About the only concession was that I was not charged.    The silver lining was Chevy.  They stepped up and offered a discount on any GM product, after they failed to get anything from the dealer.  I currently have a 2016 Malibu-from a different dealer-and I have been pleased with it.  All of this could have been avoided had the dealer shown any concern.  I have no intention of returning to the dealer and have heard nothing from them since I sold the car.  The new Malibu does not shift nearly as often as the old and gets better gas mileage.  With almost 40,000 miles on the new vehicle there have been no problems and with my driving pattern it returns over 35 mpg combined.  I am completely satisfied at this juncture.  We are looking at purchasing another vehicle.  It very well might be another Chevy, but not from that dealer.  Any concession would have kept me as a customer, but their shortsightedness might have provided a short term gain, but at a long term loss..  I had my Malibu 2LT w/ a V6 engine for 9 months.  I had it in the shop FIVE times in that period.  Once for a piston replacement, once for replacing spark plugs/cylinder coils, once for replacing wiring to cylinders, once for replacing water hose... the list of problems with this car are incredible!  On one hand, the V6 has a nice smooth get-up-and-go feel to it.  The engine sounds great but never forces the car to lose its composure on the road.  The look of the Malibu is sharp - nothing over the top, but enough smooth but pronounced edges to make you have a quick glance.  I couldn't believe this was a Chevy at first.  But then I spent a lot of time in the car and realized that the seats aren't comfortable (they squeeze and push my arms forward a bit), lumbar support sucks (optional lumbar control is mostly for show and ends up being very bad for your back according to my friend who's a practicing chiropractic).  The door materials are cheap and plastic-y, there's a lot of stuff you can tell will break easily.  The glove box had numerous scratches from a small handful of passengers getting in/out of the vehicle.  Chevy basically did a nice job updating the Malibu but failed to give it real quality interior.  The 4-cyl engine MAY be decent - fewer moving parts = fewer things to go wrong.  But I ended up with TWO V-6 engines because Jiffy Lube left my oil filter off and my engine seized a couple days later.  They paid for the replacement engine, but funny-enough the second V6 has a couple of the same issues within weeks of it being installed!  Fortunately they repairs were covered, but I lost two weeks of work over 2 months because of my car problems.  Do not buy the V6 engine, as having 2 bad engines (one of which was \\\"re-certified\\\") means this is not a good car to buy to last you several years.  Look toward 2013 and newer where the Malibu is getting much better initial quality scores and offers much better interior options..  I bought my 2011 Malibu LT2 back at the beginning of 2015 and have been using it for nearly 8 months.  I opted for a V6 because it was such an excellent price that I figured \\\"why not?\\\".  That engine has some pull to it (roughly 250hp) and sounds pretty smooth.  The only problem is the advertised fuel efficiency numbers aren't quite right.  In the city of Seattle, I get around 15-17mpg and on the freeway, if I am on cruise control between 60-65, I get sneak up to 29-31mpg (with a level road surface).  Any incline will drop the hwy mileage to around 24-25mpg.  Stop and starts with the V6 are what really murder your fuel efficiency here.  The seats are almost fine, but my back will hurt after long drives because the seats force your shoulders in a bit and my upper back is forced back - almost like a mild squeeze.  Smaller bodies probably won't notice this as much (I'm 6'2 and have a wider build that the average person), but it's an annoyance.  The quality of the Malibu LT2 is inconsistent.  I have some kind of leather/suede-fabric hybrid that makes cleaning a bit tougher than it should be.  The dashboard and door panels are composed of a cheap plastic material that scratches easily.  The instrumentation and radio/temp controls are fine.  Nothing fancy but nothing to complain about.  The 6-speaker system is adequate for most people.  You can get reasonable volumes without distortion in the audio but the system is built to cap everything off in that department before you hit those higher volumes that would degrade your listening experience.  I've heard a 2013 Malibu's 2LT/LTZ stereo which uses a Bose system (I think) and it's a step up (though still doesn't quite compete with some higher-grade car stereos out there).  As for reliability: I've had my car in a couple times this year - once for a piston replacement (fortunately under warranty, but just barely) and the other for simple coil and spark plug replacements, which are actually easy to replace, I just hadn't learned how to do it yet (a YouTube video can literally save you $500 in parts and labor for replacing one or multiple coils that sit atop your engine).  All in all the Malibu for this year is decent.  It has a solid look to it and offers decent options, depending on what trim you end up with.  The LT2 or LTZ vehicles are the best available so if you do buy one, try and look for those trims.  But from what I've been hearing about the newer Malibus - you're better off buying used 2014 and beyond because the 4cyl is closer to the Nissan Altima fuel efficiency ratings and the quality of the cabin materials has drastically improved.UPDATE: I got rid of my Malibu because the V6 engine kept having issues. I had a fuel pump issue, cylinder head issues, and more within 6 months. Had it in the shop 3 times. Jiffy Lube eventually destroyed the engine when they didn't put the oil filter all the way onto my engine after an oil change. The car was okay, if a bit cheap with cabin materials, but I've since driven a 2014 Malibu and they did a MUCH better job all around with that vehicle. Don't buy the 2008-2012 models if you can because your value is so much better in the newer ones (and the fuel efficiency is great)..  All around good car. I do about 80% highway driving and get an avg 31 mpg. People have to realize that this car is not a powerhouse; if you drive it like a high school-er you will be disappointed in your gas mileage. Treating your car nice goes a long way- tires-brakes-suspension-etc. Anyways, there's something about this car that makes me miss driving it when I'm in another vehicle. Especially my wife's dodge dart turbo..... Man that thing is a piece of crap..  I had 3 Malibu's 2006, totaled by a drunk driver.2006, totaled by a bus. Car accelerated into traffic. I reversed as my choice was a gasoline tanker and a bus.2011 : This car from day one has been a lemon.It is getting worse. I have 18 k on the car. I get 21 miles on open highway and 17 in city.I have been told by GM to put 20 more thousand miles to loosen it up. Door on drivers side leaks and has \\\"been\\\" fixed only to leak worse. At 40 mph there is a dinging in the right rear. At 60 mhp under load the steering column shakes and rattles the whole car. If you let off the gas it quits. Dealer told me this is \\\"normal\\\".Transmission fluid is dark brown...\\\"normal\\\" too.UPDATE: 3 recalls:Battery has been replace 3 times, due to a short in the \\\"electrical\\\" system. Antenna and grounding cable rotted off. Transmission kept surging. Taken to dealer via flatbed. After 38k miles. Dealer called and asked who put or changed trans fluid?When I asked why? It is I gallon over capacity. The stress from cavitation has taken its toll. The shifter is sloppy and can bee put into reverse.I met a service manager in the market. He told me that the car\\\" has a long list of electrical issues, which would cost several thousand to fix.\\\"His advice was to sell it.I asked \\\" to whom? \\\"JUNK,TRASH, Will never buy another GMC!.  Purchased a few months ago. Already put on 4,000 miles. It's a very comfortable car Me being 6'6\\\" I fit quite well. Although anyone who sits behind me had better be quite short! Monique as she is rightfully named is a snappy accelerator, corners fantastically, and I love the clad wheels. Trunk is huge. I had taken a trip to Frankfot KY. and I averaged 37.7mpg!! with a full trunk At times the remote start is finicky, but no complaints. She was a lease car before I bought her. The driver seat is kind of like crumpled near the door, which is causing a tear. Which is very disappointing. Considering my 02 Impala had over 230,000 on it and no rips or tears..  poor gas millage on a 4 cylinder 19-23mpg mostly hwy miles. traction and break control systems  failed causing accident. this is an unsafe car. car under warranty 34000 miles. GM response less than helpful. GM black box was tested for and showed no  accident infomation but driver side airbags failure in reality drivers door crushed in. Car under warranty was taken by me and GM to several dealerships, SUNSHINE CHEVROLET tech told me by the codes the two parts that would have causes the issues. GM made by back and now SUNSHINE CHEVROLET won't service  the new chevrolet..  I have owned 3 prior new GM vehicles.This one has been trouble from day 1.First it had rail dust, orange rust spots all over the car in which it took the dealer three times to fix. Then the wheels vibrated, which they never could fix. After spending at least 12 different trips to the dealer, I now have two bent rims.This car gets driven MAYBE twice a week by my wife. I will be trading this car in, and I am very disappointed with this car. Very cramped on the inside, trunk is very short, plastic trim comes off all the time.Exterior badging fell off.Horrible wheels.Horrible (20mpg) gas mileage.I will never buy a GM car again.So many recalls..  Have less than 29,000 miles on the car, the front ROTORS have been resurfaced once and replaced twice !Front BRAKES replaced once.The back ROTORS have been replaced once, and BRAKES replaced once.I have filed a complaint with GM.The mileage is not close to where they advertised !In addition the transmission doesn't act right.I have been told there is no problem with it !I would love to hear from others that have had brake and rotor issues, or anyone that has been successful at GM buying the while back ? !Please.....  Have owned this car for 20 months and wanted to wait until this point to write a review on this Malibu.This has been the most reliable car I have ever owned(and I have owned over a dozen new cars in 33years of driving). It has never been to the shop for any unscheduled service.I was not planning to trade when I did, but an unexpected windfall convinced me to trade and was glad I did!This car now has almost 25,000miles and still is as tight and quiet as the day I drove it from the dealership.Every thing works the way it is supposed to.I am averaging 26mpg in 70%/30%hwy-city driving which is NOT what I was hoping for when I bought this car, but it's not terrible..  I rented a 2011 Sonata for 3 months and was pleased to get 23.5 mpg combined. I drive about 100 miles a day and the ratio of city/highway is 50/50. We looked at buying the 2011 Sonata, Camry or Malibu because they claim to get the same mileage. We ended up with an LTZ and I am lucky to get 19 mpg combined. Pure highway driving only gets me 21 mpg. Not happy with American cars right now and it is always the drivers fault with mileage even though the cars are all driven the same way..  I like the car but, ever since it was new it has a shake at low speed when I accelerate from a stop. It only happens when a person is in the passenger front seat. I took it into the dealer for the second time for this issue and they recommended that they rotate and balance the tires at a cost to $60.00 to me. He told me that would take care of the problem, but it has'nt. If anyone has any solutions for this problem it would be greatly appreciated..  I got this car new I only have 12000 miles on it and i have complained from the first 500 miles that the car has a shake between 15 and 20 miles per hour. This has been addressed to the maintenance people at Ray Dennison with no satisfaction This is not normal per the maintenance people.I am now experiencing other things like a rumble when I accelerate.This car has been very disappointing I will never buy another probably never another chevy poor gas mileage.  Love. This. Car. We had an '05 and traded up this year (2012) for a '11. We got the baseline model for a really good price and then added a few features at Bestbuy for much cheaper than the dealer could do. I haven't had any problems with the gas mileage (getting about 28 combined). The only aspect that I'm not a fan of is the top of the dashboard. When the sun is directly overhead or in front of you, the reflection of the dashboard shines back into the windshield. It's can be distracting. Should have test driven during the evening... I've gotten used to it, but it can be a problem when you first get the car. The trunk is very deep, another plus..  I bought a 2011 lt malibu,last september,from the min.I drove it home on take off ,steering wheel you could feel a shaking ,wobble.,GM said they know about the problem but donn;t know how to fix it yet....nice you buy a carand feel this every day ,so after 6 months i take a big lose and buy a used impala...chey wins i loose...gm said they will not help me,,i also get at best 23----to -28,5 mpg...my sons impala gets 30 most of the time...junk...car and company...trunk is so tight a food cooler cann;t fit.  Bought a 2011 Malibu for the daughter.Great value with all of the rebates.Great gas milage, dependable, comfortable car for the money.Would definetley recommend..  I love this car - looks, ride, quiet, comfort and I have had absolutely no problems.I currently have 14,000 miles on it and I have had it a year.My major disappointment comes when it comes to milage my overall average mpg on this car since new is 22 mpg overall (yes I have tracked every tank). I never speed and drive very casual and this is the first car EVER that I could not achieve the advertised mpg on.I got rid of a car that would do 27 mpg all day long on the highway and 23-24 city.This car gets under 20 in town and 27-28 hwy.I ask EVERYONE I see and they all say the same thing - anyone on here that says it will do any better does not know how to track milage. 4cyl.  We have had our Malibu for a year now.The car runs well and gets very good gas mileage out on the open road.Some real problems as we see it.The temp guage that reads the outdoor temp., it is designed not to work.It will work when you get in and go to town but then it will read that same temp until you have gone over 35mph for 5 miles or 15 minuets or something like that or if your car sits for more than 3 hours.If you stay in town the whole day it will stay on the original temp of the morning even if it goes up 40 degrees.Why I ask but GM said it was designed that way.Then there is the issue of not being able to chain the car up.Also the rear head rests obstruck your view..  OK this is my second review of this car after having it for 7 months and putting almost 18000 miles on it.as stated before i owned an 09 LS and upgraded to an 11 LTZ.I liked the car enough to buy another one so that should say something.I still stand by the majority of my first review and I still love this car, but there is one major difference.GAS MILEAGE!!!The 09 had a 4 speed auto, this one has a 6 speed auto.So I should do better on gas mileage right? wrong.I drive mostly highway and got about 75 miles more on a full tank in the 09.still not bad, but chevy is flat out lying about getting 33 miles mpg.im getting 23 with 80% highway usage.otherwise great car..  This car is a pain in the A - - -. I have already voiced my dis like of the seats. And mentioned the annoying \\\"low pressure\\\" warning about the tires. After receiving and E mail advising the tire pressures are low, I check with my tire gauge and sure enough one tire has 15 lbs, another has 20 lbs., another has 12 lbs and the last has 25 lbs. WHY, WHY, WHY, WHY. !!!!!!! I have never had this problem with any car I have owned. Question:Are the tires crap?Are the wheels at fault, what is going on ?And the fuel mileage is still only 23 to 24 mpg, NOT 30 !!!!! My Nissan gets 32 mpg around town. What a piece of junk. GM should be ashamed.I have contacted GM customer service and they just .  I've had my malibu for almost a month now and it's the best car I have ever owned! I read all these reviews before I purchased and they are spot on.The thing performs like a 6 cyl and gets better gas mileage than the crummy aveo I traded in.Styling is terrific! When I pulled up to my girls house she thought it was a BMW.Few things I would change. 1st is the headroom' it's not bad when sitting in the vehicle but I often hit my head while entering. 2nd is there are no handles inside for the passengers to hold.3rd, the heated seat switch is on the seat in an awkward place.Other than that it's perfect! Tight, quiet and fun to drive...big head turner too.$25,000 for luxury at it's best!.  Bought my Malibu in January of this year.There is nothing about it that I do not like.Base model, Summit White exterior.Fantastic gas mileage. I try to focus on my driving habits and make an effort to use cruise control when possible and as result I was able to achieve 39.4 miles per gallon on a recent round-trip to Columbus OH from Indianapolis.Goal was not to exceed 65 MPH.Weekly fill-ups (40% city, 60% highway) always average 27-28 MPG. The car looks sharp inside and out.Chevy created a real winner..  I just came off a lease of a '09 Merc Milan L4 My my new Malibu is so much better in every catagory.  I purchased a a Malibu in the fall and I am very disappointed in the gas mileage, I drive mainly on the highway and only receive around 24 to 25 miles per gallon.I purchase this vehicle for the good gas mileage and chevy isn't standing behind their advertisements of 23 city to 33 highway..  I bought an LS in 2009 and it was a great car.Took a few thousand miles to get the good gas milage but it was great to have even for a basic car.Well chevy was offering some great deals on the 2011s so I decided to upgrade to a fully loaded 2011 LTZ.I couldn't be happier.It's fun to drive even for a 4 banger and looks good on the road or sitting in the parking lot.The 09 had a 4 speed auto and this one has a 6 speed auto, so it does feel a little different on shifts and sometimes will lag between shifts but overall I just love this car.Recommend to anyone..  This car is a delight to drive.I have had a malibu before and went to a HHR [no where near as nice].I went back to a malibu this year .I could not pass up the deal i got with the rebate ,credit union discount and previous owner discount.It took a while [2,000 miles] to gain thegood gas mpg .On the highway in cruise i get 35mpg with the 4 banger.Has plenty of power and rides smooth.Looks rich with the mocha exterior and cocoa/cashmere interior.I am a happy puppy with it .i hope it continues with no problems .I again say its a delightfull dish [car].  A very comfortable car with good handling, decent power,and excellent economy.Have about 6000 miles on the odometer and have gotten up to 37 mpg (at 5 mph over freeway speeds) using a light throttle and cruise control.Very good in ice and snow here in the Northeast..  Great looking car ,love to drive everyday!! .  I just bought my first Malibu about a week ago and I am quite impressed at this vehicle. I really like the design of this car. I was never impressed with the older Malibu style but GM did a nice job on this body style. I must say that it has a \\\"big car\\\" ride and the 2.4 litre 4 cyl. engine puts out a fair amount power. I am over six feet tall and I have ample headroom..  very nice car, surprised at power and overall ride control,love the white diamond paint and the way it handles in ice and snow. Overall very nice car, and impressed wit it more everyday. .  So this is our second Chevrolet. Our first was the umpteenth generation of the Suburban (a 2007). It was an awesome vehicle. Amazingly reliable. So, after our lease was up we decided to try another. With a focus on fuel economy we decided to go with the Malibu. We love this car so far it is very nice and comfortable. Extremely Quiet and the ride is very strong. We love the power of the 4 cylinder and are very impressed with the styling. Love this CAR! GM, you have won us over. .  I purchased My Malibu to save money on fuel, and have a comfortable ride. My first stop for gas netted me over 32MPG. This car is very comfortable for me (6'3\\\" and over 280lbs), although the door opening could be a little larger.I am finding the 2.4 4cyl engine to be adequate, but if you want the good MPG, you need to drive it light there is an egg between your foot and the gas pedal..  After looking at all the competition, we bough a 2008 Malibu and put 50,000 miles on it. Last week the car was totaled in an accident.The safety systems performed well. We did another review of the 2011 competition, again the answer was Malibu. Hard to beat the features performance and price..  I shopped Nissan, Hyundai, Toyota, Ford Escape, an used Mercedes Benz. After driving the Mercedes (2004 model), my daughter tried Malibu. She can hardly hear the engine.  The car is smooth and GM dealership behaved as if they were a Lexus dealership. The deal of Malibu in Black Friday was amazing. It seems GM changed the money factors that day.  The car is beautiful looking, with power. It has some indescribable feeling of exhilaration while driving it. A state of bliss that no Malibu in the past offered. It awakens self-confidence in drivers who feel much richer and free. Its a car for the young, suddenly. It help you aim high and see possible what one thought impossible before..  I find this to be a very comfortable and quite car. It handles very well and I think it also looks very good. It also has very good mpg. I drive around 70 miles every day and this car makes the drive very pleasant. As a whole, I am very happy with this car and will certainly recommend it..  The car is new, so too soon to tell if it will stand up to the test of time. I like the look of the car. Seats not great, could be more comfortable. Love the on star feature. When I needed help with getting a spare the Chevy dealership, and the Chevy corporate headquarters was very unresponsive. I would hate to have to deal with them over a really serious issue, they just don't seem to care once your out the door and they have your money. .  I just brought my car. I am in love. I was going for an 08 2lt, however i left with an 2011 1LT with a sunroof in blue. .  Just purchased in October 2010. A very pleasant and quiet driving experience especially on smooth roads. Much less quiet on bumpy roads. The car handles beautifully. I am already getting 5 MPH better overall than with my 2003 Buick and i am looking forward for even better mileage as i break it in. Average now is 27 MPG. The bucket seats are not as soft as i am used to but i think i can get used to them. Bluetooth and on star are excellent features and i am already using them.\",\n          \" Be sure to check Warranty package.  This is a really great car for the price point. Remember that this is an entry level economy car. Keeping that criteria in mind and you will not find a better value considering the 10 year warranty. No other manufacturer is standing by that long to keep your car running tops. The one issue I have found is that the fuel mileage is not as good as it should be for a 1.6L 4cyl. Mine is the 6 speed automatic and I average 27-30 mpg with a mix of driving. If you drive really easy and with great care, you can get the average up to 30-33 mpg. That is a lot less than is shown on the sticker. I can still say that it is very nice car for running around town and will hold quite a bit of storage when the seats are folded down. No regrets on this little car so far. I have put about 22K miles on it..  The trunk space isn't the best, but besides that its been a great car..  The seatbelt has a bulge that rubs against your left leg causing leg injury ..  Yes it's green!  Great car!  Quiet.  Great pickup on sport mode.  Dealership worked to get me great deal..  My wife first had a 2010 Soul and traded it on a new new 2012 VW Beetle.  We traded that in a year later on a 2014 Soul ! for her and one for me.  We really liked those cars but are always looking at others.  Traded them in on 2 Chevy Trax, the top model.  Then about a year and half went back to to the Souls.  One for each  of us and we are not going to change.  Easy in and out, more elbow room than the Trax and more storage room.  Love and use the under floor storage in the back.  Don't feel cramped in the seats which are very comfortable.  Our trip via car to Las Vegas from Minnesota was very nice.  The 200 hp engine in the ! was not taxed by the Rockies. No extreme down-shifting when going up the mountains.  Carried all our luggage (and we have a lot because we are gone for 10 days and all our electronics,pills and food.  The touch screen radio and navigation and climate controls are easy to use (we are 68 and 70 years old.)  Gas mileage around town is consistently 24 to 25 MPG and highway runs 31 or so.  Most of the Souls we see on the road or in town are driven by older people who need easy in and out and all the other features..  I get decent mileage but the MPG estimate on the dash consistently over-estimates by 5-10% (versus actual miles driven at each fill-up). The Bluetooth button on the 2017 model is actually a Siri button, so if you don't have an iPhone, it does absolutely nothing. Hands-free on an Android is limited to only answering an incoming call or calling the last phone number in your history..  Car was a rental while on vacation and fell in love with it. Easy to get in and out of and handled like a dream. Gas mileage was good and car was very quiet. Glad I got a chance to drive it and would definitely consider buying..  Tired of having to squirm and twist to get in and out of your car?  Try that in a Soul.  Then take it for a drive.  Convinced me. Long warranty from factory helped, too..  I have a three year lease on a 2017 Soul. I have owned the vehicle for just a few weeks now. In that time I have made the following observations. It is important to keep in mind that this is a base vehicle. I see it filling a niche was owned by the VW Bug, with technology and comfort. My 1.6 130 hp with an automatic transmission is plenty of motor for this car. The mileage is amazing and I love all the technology that tells me about my consumption and range.  I find that I drive a bit slower in this vehicle for some reason. Getting in and out are important to me and this is done with ease. I wish the front seat had a few more adjustments but it is fairly comfortable. The Soul is easy to drive and the ergonomics are good. The technology is easy to understand and use for an older driver like me, love the Bluetooth.. This vehicle is easy to park and navigate well in tighter areas. The one real knock on the Soul is that its smaller windows create very dangerous blind spots. If you don't have a warning system and I don't, the passenger side has a huge driver's blind spot. The drivers side is also bad but not as bad. Overall I am delighted with my KIA Soul..  This car has most of the things I wanted in a vehicle all put into one.  I had been searching and test drove quite a few vehicles and walked away from each disappointed about something.  That was not the case with this one.  The ride is smooth and the EXCLAIM is very quick.  I used to drive a smaller hatchback and got tired of having essentially fall into my car.  With the soul, the seats are at waist height and I quite literally just walk into my seat.  Just yesterday, I took a friend out in it who owns a truck and he mentioned this very thing.  He was saying he has to climb up into his truck and loves that you can just walk into the seat.  I said the same thing regarding my golf (as you just read).  I also got the Tech Package and I am very pleased with the sound system.  It is superb.  Definitely not a miss there.  The audio controls actually make sense and is very easy to navigate.  I test drove some cars that were just way too complicated (looking at you Honda).  We don't want complicated while we're driving.  I want to push 2 buttons max to get where I want and do what I want.  The fuel economy is actually lower than advertised, and that's kind of a bummer.  I drive mostly (that's 90%) interstate and am lucky if I break 28 overall.  The A/C unit is not what I'd call amazing.  There are definitely better A/C units out there.  Other than that... very comfortable.  Drives great.  Turns on a dime (better than my Hatchback did, but the hatchback handled like a dream... cuz it's a hatchback).  I am not at all disappointed and would highly recommend it.  Also, Kia's warranty kind of tells a story of a company who's not afraid to offer a high warranty because they have faith in their product.  Seriously, their warranty is twice as good as anyone else's.  Highly recommended..  I now own two Kia Souls - The first one (2013) was so impressive in build quality I bought a second upon reading the 2017 reviews. When Car and Driver and Road and Track give a 4.5 out of 5 stars - one pays attention. The 2017 I own Is simply amazing in build quality, ride handling and amenities ...... No comparison out there especially considering price..  had a 2012 soul and traded in for a 2017 model.  Not many changes between the years, except 2017 does not come with a cd player standard.  Still no spare tire.  new car has the nitrogen filled tires.  I like the car for the handling, and overall comfort. but its overpriced..  I've always liked the Kia Souls but never got one because I felt they were under powered. Enter the 2017 Kia Soul ! and its 1.6L turbo engine. The engine isn't the problem with this car. The problem is that it is only available on the Exclaim model and the Exclaim has added and subtracted a few things. They've added a red strip that goes around the bottom of the exterior and gave the interior Leather/cloth seats with orange stitching. They didn't make the Soul a race car by any means, they just added an engine that gave it enough power not to feel like you had to floor it everywhere you went. So why would they make it like a kids toy and add stupid little things like that? On to the list of things that are gone.  The front cooled seats are no longer an option and the heated front seats are still there but  now only have 2 heat settings instead of 3. Those items are still available on the Soul +. So instead of getting the Soul ! that used to be the top trim level you're getting a Soul ! that isn't even fully loaded. Still, it is a great car Kia just needs to figure out their color schemes and option availability.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":69}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_manufacturer_year_base_model_customer_review = pd.concat([df_unique_manufacturer_year_base_model, retrieved_reviews_df], axis=1)\n","df_manufacturer_year_base_model_customer_review.columns = [\"car_manufacturer\",\\\n","                                                           \"car_model_year\",\\\n","                                                           \"base_model\",\\\n","                                                           \"engine\",\\\n","                                                           \"customer_review\",]\n","df_manufacturer_year_base_model_customer_review"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":424},"id":"RCninP8sKmyM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711026710403,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":447,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Zhvanskiy","userId":"11978303123960557609"}},"outputId":"e5bf60ed-cee8-4129-b65c-b9cf1185bcc0"},"execution_count":70,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["     car_manufacturer  car_model_year base_model engine  \\\n","0               Adamo            1984        CRX    1.8   \n","1               Adamo            1979        GTL    1.6   \n","2              Agrale            2005     Marruá    2.8   \n","3              Agrale            2007     Marruá    2.8   \n","4              Agrale            2010     Marruá    2.8   \n","...               ...             ...        ...    ...   \n","4672            Volvo            2004       XC90    2.9   \n","4673            Volvo            2005       XC90    2.9   \n","4674            Volvo            2006       XC90    2.9   \n","4675         W Motors            2015      Fenyr    3.7   \n","4676         W Motors            2013      Lykan    3.7   \n","\n","                                        customer_review  \n","0                                                   NaN  \n","1                                                   NaN  \n","2                                                   NaN  \n","3                                                   NaN  \n","4                                                   NaN  \n","...                                                 ...  \n","4672   Biggest of the mid size suvs. The seats are t...  \n","4673   Tough to beat a volvo.

Safest car I've ever own..  Over 1/2 the cars we've owned have been Volvo...This one will change that. This has had constant noise in the form of clunks, squeals and rattles. There is always an error light or message on and we've spent a small fortune on parts. I'm a certified ASE mechanic and do all my own work but this has been a challenge. New rack and pinion, new exhaust, new struts, new springs, new tie rod ends, new radiator, new pulleys and new tires every 15K. This thing cant keep tires or brakes! The gas mileage is great, the power wonderful but everything else failed. The stereo is substandard and no one will touch it for aftermarket because of Volvos proprietary computers. The mirror trim has fallen off, the light dimmer/turn signal indicator fell off, windows get stuck. In short, this has left my wife stranded more then any vehicle she's owned. Tried to talk with dealership about issues but they create even more...worst dealer we've ever worked with. Tried to talk with Volvo and they didn't care. You can get a lemon but when the dealer and the manufacture wont help and in fact, exasperate the situation, it tells you it's time to move on. We're shopping for two new vehicles and wouldn't consider owning another Volvo. We actually bought a 2012 BMW X3. It's the best vehicle I've ever owned. Customer support is off the charts compared to Volvo and the vehicle arnt even in the same league! I'm angry at myself for waiting so long to get rid of Volvo...you really can enjoy your SUV.  My XC-90 is horrible, front to back.Friends don\\u0092t let friends buy volvo\\u0092s. Treatment from the volvo dealerships in Houston is horrible, unless you are super rich, they will certainly hook you up, otherwise, bring your checkbook.You pay out the nose to own a volvo. My xc-90? 3 sets of wheel bearings burned out, the rear end went out, the fuel pump has already been replaced, the CURRENT check engine light issue will cost me $1,000, just put $1,500 into it to get the steering column to work again, the Houston dealership seriously jacked me over. you HAVE to take it to the dealership. They know they've got you by the throat. OBTW, my windshield leaks. Headlights fogged from inside. $500 each.  Purchased a used 2006 Volvo XC90 AWD V8 a year ago, had 77K miles on it, but was in excellent condition and we thought very safe for our family.We didn't know it had a transmission that COULD NOT be repaired ONLY REPLACED.The Volvo dealership informed us that this particular transmission was not repairable.Unfortunately our warranty company wouldn't ok the replacement so we had to transfer the car to a transmission repair facility to try and rebuild it.They were able to get all the parts needed but 1 and Volvo wouldn't sell the 1 part that would fix our car.SO we had to purchase a USED transmission for $5,700.00 (new would have been $7,500)..  We purchased my Volvo used in 2007 and it had 36,000 miles on it.  We had recently had our second child and loved the safety features and quality of this car.  (Not to mention it is beautiful) It came with a few flaws, poor fuel consumption and rear doors that don't open wide enough in the back to get kids/groceries misc in and out.  Third row is a joke really, no room for normal sized adults.  Ok for children but hard to get them in and out.  Overall this vehicle made me happy for 3 years and we never had any repairs other than scheduled maintenance.  Just traded it in on a minivan due to our THIRD child arriving, but still missing my Volvo.  I'll have another one again someday..  110k mi & still drives fantastic! Smooth, powerful, tight handling & fun to drive. Happy with whole drivetrain.  Only problem so far was the \\\"infotainment software bug,\\\" which was fixed with quick update @ dealer.  DON'T get turbo model with \\\"garbage\\\" GM transmission. The V8's avg 1mpg gas penalty is worth every drop!  '05+ Yamaha V8 model has better Aisan Warner 6-speed & nice AWD system.  Did i mention the significant testicular fortitude?.  I bought this car used in Nov of 2008 and have had it for almost a year and a half.  I have not had one problem with this car.  I am very pleased with the performance.  The gas mileage could be better but i knew that going in.  The interior does not have enough space for all my stuff but I manage.  I really love driving this car and feel very safe in it. .  We've had the XC90 since Dec. 05 and have only performed scheduled maintenance. Comfort, safety, and reliability have been excellent. .  Got this car for thousands off because I bought it in 2007 when it was a 2006 model, but it was new. Very happy with the looks outside and inside. After a 5 months I had some problems, some anti-skid message that kept coming up, they said it was a computer problem but it happened twice. Possibly due to extremely horrible speed bumps where I live the car began making weird clicks when the gas/brakes were pressed; brake pads, alignment, sub-frame, etc all needed work. Right window makes whistling noise. DVD system headphones sound fuzzy sometimes. Very fast for an SUV, and I always feel safe..  I've had my '06 for 16 months now but before that had an 05.  Just test drove an ML 350 from Mercedes and I must say I prefer my Volvo. Granted the ML had a few features that were nice but overall, my Volvo had much more comfortable seats and more features for the price, i.e. dvd system, memory driver's seat, etc. I also have much more cargo area in my Volvo and because it's a bigger car I have more legroom and just feel safer. Close the doors on the Mercedes and do the same with the Volvo and you'll know the difference. My only gripe so far with the Volvo is the cheaply made stereo speaker units in the front corners. Should be better for a 50K+ vehicle..  An excellent car, firm ride.  You have the feeling of being in a safe car.  Goes through snow with ease. Very good handling.  I recommend this car to anyone who wants a safe car.  Gas mileage is a bit off and the gas tank is relatively small for a car of this size..  I love the ride but it has died in the middle of a busy intersection twice. It had to be towed back to the dealership and they replaced the fuel pump and we are waiting to see what they think it is this time. The driver's side beam has had to be replaced twice. The DVD system works intermittently. I thought Volvos were supposed to be dependable and safe. I have a 3 year old and I am going to have to get something else unfortunately..  Purchased a 2003 XC90 T6 new. Traded it in for a XC90 V8 in 2006. Totally different vehicle. Engine powerful and quiet.  No comparison with the T6.  T6 noisy, rough running and a gas hog.  V8 smooth as silk and much better MPG. Also, the T6 was a five passenger, the V8 a 7.  The V8 rides much smoother because of the self leveling rear. All in all a world class vehicle with a top IIHS safety rating. You can spend a lot more money on an SUV and I don't think you can buy a much better vehicle.  Dollar for dollar an excellent investment.  .  I have had my XC90 for just over a year now.  It's the best vehicle I've ever owned but has some small drawbacks that I can overlook. The driver seat is already starting to feel as if it is wearing on the outer bolster.  Overall it handles great for its size and does better than great on the autobahn in Germany at speed.  The 6-speed tip-tronic changes are somewhat slushy during gear changes.  I still compare it to the Touareg and LR3 that my co-workers have and I find it to be a better vehicle than theirs.  Some of the options could come down in price.  Over $3k for navigation is too much.  I bought an aftermarket system for less than $600.  But you pay quality money for a quality SUV..  From the delivery from Neftin Volvo ( awesome dealership) the XC90 has been my favorite car ever.  Rides like a magic carpet and off roads like rhino.  I LOVE IT!.  I waited 2 yrs for this car!  Needed the suv body style,  very happy with this!  A few minor problems (computer errors).  At 25,000 miles, had to replace tires.  Not happy about that. Was told its common on Awd suvs?!  Would like to know what other owners think about this.  .  I replaced a BMW X3 with this car. As I wanted a little more room, I compared it to the 2006 BMW X5. The ORE is a better value.  Hesitant about the V-8, but average mileage is 20.0 mpg in mixed driving.  My 2.5L X3 averaged 22 mpg.  I gave up 2 mpg for an extra 125 h.p., a smoother ride and more room -an excellent trade off.  Excellent storage and cargo space. Very quiet ride. .  I purchased the Volvo XC90 V8 due to the safety and convenience features.  I have nothing but problems with the SUV.  It stalls and is a hazard.  Upon checking the internet, there are many purchasers that have had problems with the Volvo XC90.  Next time I will stick to Toyota/Lexus.  This Volvo is a headache.  By the way, this is supposed to be my wife's SUV.  She is 7 months pregnant.  She will not be driving this vehicle!  Another issue is the towing capacity.  It is rated at 5000 pounds.  This is with the driver only.  Any passengers and cargo decreases this capacity rapidly.  Also, it requires a transmission cooler and brake controller.  The dealers won't install them..  Last vehicle was a 2004 Acura MDX. The XC90 has a better, with the V8, engine and transmission. Very comfortable with most of the controls in a good position. Only have 700 miles but have been averaging 19 mpg. Only driven it in the rain but the handling, while not sporty, is good. If you want a good overall SUV, this should be high on your list. Any BMW X5 will offer better handling and performance but doesn't have the cargo space..  solid, safe and with surprising performance. did 20.6 mpg on an interstate trip of 800 miles [doing a steady 80]..  Very impressive for a SUV - sturdy, good power, nice drive.  Quality interior & overall design - unmatched safety..  Before going for the XC90 V8, I drove the Porsche Cayanne S, Lexus GX470, Lexus LX470 and Acura MDX, Whiule the other SUV's had a lot more bells and whistles (voice activated Navigation/Bluetooth, etc.), this SUV had the best performance, look, feel and room of the bunch, for the price. I love the power, the cabin is very nicely appointed. Everything is logically laid out and performs perfectly. I added the Bluetooth system, which works great with our phones. This is my third SUV and I am completely sold on Volvos after driving this one..  This SUV rides like a sedan.  The Yamaha V8 gives it plenty of power. I can't say enough good things about it.  The roomy interior has a clean, elegant look to it and the stereo is excellent and powerful.  Considering the projected resale value (best in class) You should not hesitate to buy one. .  After much dreaming and waiting for a VOLVO SUV, the XC90 does not disappoint. It's a comfortable, safe people mover that gives everybody a great ride (3rd row seats are higher for better views). The V8/6-speeds are mated nicely (purrs well!). Good snow traction and power here in the Rockies and for the highways on OE all-season tires (special winter tires were not needed). Love the split rear hatch and easy access throughout. Beautiful looking vehicle, great lines and finish. A solid and well built machine. Well designed and thoughtful interior. Easy to read dials and settings (although the radio is a bit clunky to set). We're going to get the Bluetooth installed next month. Great SUV. \",\n          \" Solid vehicle, no major repairs in 7 years of ownership, mileage isn\\u2019t a plus, but excellent overall value otherwise..  The car is great and is very roomy for a sedan. It doesn't get great gas mileage when traveling in the city, but it is comfortable. I wish the A/C vents had a switch to turn them off. A big complaint is that in order to replace the headlights, you need to take it to a dealership or car repair shop, because the whole front bumper needs to be taken off to access the headlights. Other than the dumb design of that, I really love the car!.  Be sure to look around any buy the one you want, some Malibus from this generation have different features than others like remote start, sun roof, color options, etc. Be sure to shop around and buy what you want! This car is awesome on long highway trips! Very comfortable and great gas mileage!.  Great car to save money on gas and use for long trips..  Unless you enjoy dropping hundreds-thousands of dollars on repairs every couple of months do not buy this car! As soon as it\\u2019s warranty expires it starts falling apart. Not to mention it\\u2019s nearly impossible to work on it yourself as GM specially designed it to require special tools and equipment to fix. Even simple problems like a broken speaker turn costly fast. I\\u2019ve already replaced the transmission, had to replace all 4 brakes multiple times, had the body control module \\u201crepaired\\u201d under a recall (which started going bad again a couple years later and no, they won\\u2019t fix it again), the cruise control won\\u2019t always disengage when you press the brakes (scarey!!!), the brake lights only work sometimes, the speakers only work sometimes, and the list only goes on from there. At this point I am trying to wash my hands of this piece of garbage by selling it and getting a little bit of money back, it\\u2019s only been able to go about 1-3 weeks at a before something else brakes so I have to keep sticking money into it so I can even sell it. I am also learning the hard way how fast these cars depreciate. My car is only 6 years old and sold for around $25,000 new and is now worth about $7,000, a little over half of what I paid a few years ago. That\\u2019s with only 94,000 miles and no rust, dents, or scratches. I wouldn\\u2019t tak another Chevy or even GM vehicle of someone paid me..  Wonky transmission, poor paint quality, and overall drabness drove me to switch to an Asian-made vehicle for the first time in my life..  Don't buy this car. I got this for a good deal in 2013, at the time the car was 2 years old and had less then 40k miles on it. Should have got the extended warranty because the transmission gave out entirely last year after just 95k miles (!!). It cost $3500 to replace, which is likely more than the car was worth. Lots of little problems every service, easily costing me thousands over the last four years. This despite me taking it to the dealer for service every six months and following all recommended procedures. The mileage is quite poor, and the car is does not accelerate as quickly as one would hope. Also, if the headlamps go out, you have to remove the front bumper just to change it (pathetic design - really hope that GM engineer was fired). So what should be a $20 fix is instead $150 with the labor charges. The only upside to this car is the storage room and legroom, which are both quite good. But otherwise it is no-frills, and pretty poor build quality. I would not recommend this car to anyone..  This was the least comfortable car I have ever owned. The seats were hard and the seams cut into the lower back and tail bone. The interior cabin was noisy and we could hear all the road noise and feel every road bump.  We traded it in after about 7 months and LOST over 12,000 in resale value!  I would not recommend this car to my worst enemy!.  If you by used dealers charge way more than its worth. Motor troubles at 70000 even if you maintain. Buy it out right do not finance otherwise make sure you have at leat 5000 stocked away for car emergencies. Make sure you get a good warranty dont go with C.A.R.S PLUS PROTECTION they dont cover much. This car will give you financial blues . Brake sysytem too sensors are no if good. If you have children steer clear!!!!!.  Two days after buying it I had to put it in the shop a bunch of recalls feel unsafe to drive and transport my kids in.  For the few years between carting kids to practice then college in a mini-van I had a sports car.  THEN my kids had kids :-) and I needed a car that could hold up to three car seats / booster seats depending on grandkids in the back seat.  There is room and the back seat is a \\\"flat\\\" bench with pre-installed hooks for carseats.  Hook to the frame on both sides of the bottom, hook to the frame behind headrest and seats were appropriately installed and *I* did it!  Easy in and out as I also transport my elderly parents in the car.  Both front and back doors open wide (be sure passengers know that lest the next car get dinged) and I can have Mom put both legs out and on the ground, she holds the bracket and my hand and up we go.  I regret that I don't have leather seats, which I've always had.  However, the upholstery is of good quality and cleans with a babywipe.  I'm picky about dust, etc, and it looks great just driving through a carwash.  The computer in the car is so accurate I know when tire pressure needs attention, mpg readout is accurate, oil life.  Poor quality inside and out, with a lot of plastic.  However, it's a comfortable and quiet car that's easy to drive in any weather..  .  This car is AWESOME. FUN TO DRIVE SUPER SAFE AND RELIABLE I HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT!!.  What a mistake this piece of junk is. There are countless recalls and they are all on insignificant things. Do yourself a favor and google \\\"2011 Chevy Malibu Engine Power Decreased\\\" and read the reviews about this POS. There is no recall for a problem that costs not only $2,000 TO FIX, but can be deadly. Long story short, there is a faulty sensor that goes out somewhere between 50,000-120,000 miles (roll of the dice) that is going to without warning make your car shake and reduce your engine power. There are stories about people on the freeway that had this happen while driving and their car dropped to 25 miles per hour.Go in to get it fixed, $2,000 to replace the damage this stupid sensor has caused. Don't buy this car. Ever. For any reason. Until there is a full recall don't touch it..  I can't say enough good things about this car!  It runs super quiet, has great pick up and passing power, rides smooth, gets great gas mileage (27/mpg combined for me with 50/50 city/highway), looks sharp and has awesome audio system. I'm thinking of buying another one right one for one of my teenagers. It's been a while since we've owned a domestic car but the 2011 Malibu has changed our minds - we're a Chevy family now!!.  I have bought GM products starting with a 1967 Camaro through even a Chevy Vega and continuing to the present up to and including the aforementioned 2011 Malibu.  My guess is that I have purchased over the years about 20 GM products, so this comment does not come from a closet Ford or Dodge owner.  At 120,000 miles the transmission just quit.  Everyone I know who owns something other than a GM product have in excess of  that with no problem.  I try to be loyal to not only the brand but the dealership.  Basically, I was told by the dealer here in Idaho that your car is worth nothing and a transmission will cost you $3,500.  So the car is at the dealership and I have had to borrow cars to get around.  Your alternatives are few short of putting a for sale sign on the car and parking it at the dealership.  There was no effort to try to ameliorate the frustration by either the company or the dealership.  I will put in  the transmission, but I will not return to Chevrolet or the dealership.  The lesson to be learned  from this to always get the cheapest price as there is no advantage to being loyal to a brand or a dealer.  The travails continued after I picked up the car,with new transmission, it sounded awful when it started lots of valve clatter and before I got out of the parking lot the check engine light came on.  On Star diagnostics said it needed to go back to the dealer.  After having it for at least two weeks and paying them $3,500 the car was not running.  The service manager was busy explaining it was not his fault and I was busy thinking that is a load of crap.  To say I was angry and disappointed would be an under statement.  He said it would take 40 minutes to change the now defective sensor; he was back in less than 5.  Clearly they failed to make all the proper connections and it was just a question of correcting that.  About the only concession was that I was not charged.    The silver lining was Chevy.  They stepped up and offered a discount on any GM product, after they failed to get anything from the dealer.  I currently have a 2016 Malibu-from a different dealer-and I have been pleased with it.  All of this could have been avoided had the dealer shown any concern.  I have no intention of returning to the dealer and have heard nothing from them since I sold the car.  The new Malibu does not shift nearly as often as the old and gets better gas mileage.  With almost 40,000 miles on the new vehicle there have been no problems and with my driving pattern it returns over 35 mpg combined.  I am completely satisfied at this juncture.  We are looking at purchasing another vehicle.  It very well might be another Chevy, but not from that dealer.  Any concession would have kept me as a customer, but their shortsightedness might have provided a short term gain, but at a long term loss..  I had my Malibu 2LT w/ a V6 engine for 9 months.  I had it in the shop FIVE times in that period.  Once for a piston replacement, once for replacing spark plugs/cylinder coils, once for replacing wiring to cylinders, once for replacing water hose... the list of problems with this car are incredible!  On one hand, the V6 has a nice smooth get-up-and-go feel to it.  The engine sounds great but never forces the car to lose its composure on the road.  The look of the Malibu is sharp - nothing over the top, but enough smooth but pronounced edges to make you have a quick glance.  I couldn't believe this was a Chevy at first.  But then I spent a lot of time in the car and realized that the seats aren't comfortable (they squeeze and push my arms forward a bit), lumbar support sucks (optional lumbar control is mostly for show and ends up being very bad for your back according to my friend who's a practicing chiropractic).  The door materials are cheap and plastic-y, there's a lot of stuff you can tell will break easily.  The glove box had numerous scratches from a small handful of passengers getting in/out of the vehicle.  Chevy basically did a nice job updating the Malibu but failed to give it real quality interior.  The 4-cyl engine MAY be decent - fewer moving parts = fewer things to go wrong.  But I ended up with TWO V-6 engines because Jiffy Lube left my oil filter off and my engine seized a couple days later.  They paid for the replacement engine, but funny-enough the second V6 has a couple of the same issues within weeks of it being installed!  Fortunately they repairs were covered, but I lost two weeks of work over 2 months because of my car problems.  Do not buy the V6 engine, as having 2 bad engines (one of which was \\\"re-certified\\\") means this is not a good car to buy to last you several years.  Look toward 2013 and newer where the Malibu is getting much better initial quality scores and offers much better interior options..  I bought my 2011 Malibu LT2 back at the beginning of 2015 and have been using it for nearly 8 months.  I opted for a V6 because it was such an excellent price that I figured \\\"why not?\\\".  That engine has some pull to it (roughly 250hp) and sounds pretty smooth.  The only problem is the advertised fuel efficiency numbers aren't quite right.  In the city of Seattle, I get around 15-17mpg and on the freeway, if I am on cruise control between 60-65, I get sneak up to 29-31mpg (with a level road surface).  Any incline will drop the hwy mileage to around 24-25mpg.  Stop and starts with the V6 are what really murder your fuel efficiency here.  The seats are almost fine, but my back will hurt after long drives because the seats force your shoulders in a bit and my upper back is forced back - almost like a mild squeeze.  Smaller bodies probably won't notice this as much (I'm 6'2 and have a wider build that the average person), but it's an annoyance.  The quality of the Malibu LT2 is inconsistent.  I have some kind of leather/suede-fabric hybrid that makes cleaning a bit tougher than it should be.  The dashboard and door panels are composed of a cheap plastic material that scratches easily.  The instrumentation and radio/temp controls are fine.  Nothing fancy but nothing to complain about.  The 6-speaker system is adequate for most people.  You can get reasonable volumes without distortion in the audio but the system is built to cap everything off in that department before you hit those higher volumes that would degrade your listening experience.  I've heard a 2013 Malibu's 2LT/LTZ stereo which uses a Bose system (I think) and it's a step up (though still doesn't quite compete with some higher-grade car stereos out there).  As for reliability: I've had my car in a couple times this year - once for a piston replacement (fortunately under warranty, but just barely) and the other for simple coil and spark plug replacements, which are actually easy to replace, I just hadn't learned how to do it yet (a YouTube video can literally save you $500 in parts and labor for replacing one or multiple coils that sit atop your engine).  All in all the Malibu for this year is decent.  It has a solid look to it and offers decent options, depending on what trim you end up with.  The LT2 or LTZ vehicles are the best available so if you do buy one, try and look for those trims.  But from what I've been hearing about the newer Malibus - you're better off buying used 2014 and beyond because the 4cyl is closer to the Nissan Altima fuel efficiency ratings and the quality of the cabin materials has drastically improved.UPDATE: I got rid of my Malibu because the V6 engine kept having issues. I had a fuel pump issue, cylinder head issues, and more within 6 months. Had it in the shop 3 times. Jiffy Lube eventually destroyed the engine when they didn't put the oil filter all the way onto my engine after an oil change. The car was okay, if a bit cheap with cabin materials, but I've since driven a 2014 Malibu and they did a MUCH better job all around with that vehicle. Don't buy the 2008-2012 models if you can because your value is so much better in the newer ones (and the fuel efficiency is great)..  All around good car. I do about 80% highway driving and get an avg 31 mpg. People have to realize that this car is not a powerhouse; if you drive it like a high school-er you will be disappointed in your gas mileage. Treating your car nice goes a long way- tires-brakes-suspension-etc. Anyways, there's something about this car that makes me miss driving it when I'm in another vehicle. Especially my wife's dodge dart turbo..... Man that thing is a piece of crap..  I had 3 Malibu's 2006, totaled by a drunk driver.2006, totaled by a bus. Car accelerated into traffic. I reversed as my choice was a gasoline tanker and a bus.2011 : This car from day one has been a lemon.It is getting worse. I have 18 k on the car. I get 21 miles on open highway and 17 in city.I have been told by GM to put 20 more thousand miles to loosen it up. Door on drivers side leaks and has \\\"been\\\" fixed only to leak worse. At 40 mph there is a dinging in the right rear. At 60 mhp under load the steering column shakes and rattles the whole car. If you let off the gas it quits. Dealer told me this is \\\"normal\\\".Transmission fluid is dark brown...\\\"normal\\\" too.UPDATE: 3 recalls:Battery has been replace 3 times, due to a short in the \\\"electrical\\\" system. Antenna and grounding cable rotted off. Transmission kept surging. Taken to dealer via flatbed. After 38k miles. Dealer called and asked who put or changed trans fluid?When I asked why? It is I gallon over capacity. The stress from cavitation has taken its toll. The shifter is sloppy and can bee put into reverse.I met a service manager in the market. He told me that the car\\\" has a long list of electrical issues, which would cost several thousand to fix.\\\"His advice was to sell it.I asked \\\" to whom? \\\"JUNK,TRASH, Will never buy another GMC!.  Purchased a few months ago. Already put on 4,000 miles. It's a very comfortable car Me being 6'6\\\" I fit quite well. Although anyone who sits behind me had better be quite short! Monique as she is rightfully named is a snappy accelerator, corners fantastically, and I love the clad wheels. Trunk is huge. I had taken a trip to Frankfot KY. and I averaged 37.7mpg!! with a full trunk At times the remote start is finicky, but no complaints. She was a lease car before I bought her. The driver seat is kind of like crumpled near the door, which is causing a tear. Which is very disappointing. Considering my 02 Impala had over 230,000 on it and no rips or tears..  poor gas millage on a 4 cylinder 19-23mpg mostly hwy miles. traction and break control systems  failed causing accident. this is an unsafe car. car under warranty 34000 miles. GM response less than helpful. GM black box was tested for and showed no  accident infomation but driver side airbags failure in reality drivers door crushed in. Car under warranty was taken by me and GM to several dealerships, SUNSHINE CHEVROLET tech told me by the codes the two parts that would have causes the issues. GM made by back and now SUNSHINE CHEVROLET won't service  the new chevrolet..  I have owned 3 prior new GM vehicles.This one has been trouble from day 1.First it had rail dust, orange rust spots all over the car in which it took the dealer three times to fix. Then the wheels vibrated, which they never could fix. After spending at least 12 different trips to the dealer, I now have two bent rims.This car gets driven MAYBE twice a week by my wife. I will be trading this car in, and I am very disappointed with this car. Very cramped on the inside, trunk is very short, plastic trim comes off all the time.Exterior badging fell off.Horrible wheels.Horrible (20mpg) gas mileage.I will never buy a GM car again.So many recalls..  Have less than 29,000 miles on the car, the front ROTORS have been resurfaced once and replaced twice !Front BRAKES replaced once.The back ROTORS have been replaced once, and BRAKES replaced once.I have filed a complaint with GM.The mileage is not close to where they advertised !In addition the transmission doesn't act right.I have been told there is no problem with it !I would love to hear from others that have had brake and rotor issues, or anyone that has been successful at GM buying the while back ? !Please.....  Have owned this car for 20 months and wanted to wait until this point to write a review on this Malibu.This has been the most reliable car I have ever owned(and I have owned over a dozen new cars in 33years of driving). It has never been to the shop for any unscheduled service.I was not planning to trade when I did, but an unexpected windfall convinced me to trade and was glad I did!This car now has almost 25,000miles and still is as tight and quiet as the day I drove it from the dealership.Every thing works the way it is supposed to.I am averaging 26mpg in 70%/30%hwy-city driving which is NOT what I was hoping for when I bought this car, but it's not terrible..  I rented a 2011 Sonata for 3 months and was pleased to get 23.5 mpg combined. I drive about 100 miles a day and the ratio of city/highway is 50/50. We looked at buying the 2011 Sonata, Camry or Malibu because they claim to get the same mileage. We ended up with an LTZ and I am lucky to get 19 mpg combined. Pure highway driving only gets me 21 mpg. Not happy with American cars right now and it is always the drivers fault with mileage even though the cars are all driven the same way..  I like the car but, ever since it was new it has a shake at low speed when I accelerate from a stop. It only happens when a person is in the passenger front seat. I took it into the dealer for the second time for this issue and they recommended that they rotate and balance the tires at a cost to $60.00 to me. He told me that would take care of the problem, but it has'nt. If anyone has any solutions for this problem it would be greatly appreciated..  I got this car new I only have 12000 miles on it and i have complained from the first 500 miles that the car has a shake between 15 and 20 miles per hour. This has been addressed to the maintenance people at Ray Dennison with no satisfaction This is not normal per the maintenance people.I am now experiencing other things like a rumble when I accelerate.This car has been very disappointing I will never buy another probably never another chevy poor gas mileage.  Love. This. Car. We had an '05 and traded up this year (2012) for a '11. We got the baseline model for a really good price and then added a few features at Bestbuy for much cheaper than the dealer could do. I haven't had any problems with the gas mileage (getting about 28 combined). The only aspect that I'm not a fan of is the top of the dashboard. When the sun is directly overhead or in front of you, the reflection of the dashboard shines back into the windshield. It's can be distracting. Should have test driven during the evening... I've gotten used to it, but it can be a problem when you first get the car. The trunk is very deep, another plus..  I bought a 2011 lt malibu,last september,from the min.I drove it home on take off ,steering wheel you could feel a shaking ,wobble.,GM said they know about the problem but donn;t know how to fix it yet....nice you buy a carand feel this every day ,so after 6 months i take a big lose and buy a used impala...chey wins i loose...gm said they will not help me,,i also get at best 23----to -28,5 mpg...my sons impala gets 30 most of the time...junk...car and company...trunk is so tight a food cooler cann;t fit.  Bought a 2011 Malibu for the daughter.Great value with all of the rebates.Great gas milage, dependable, comfortable car for the money.Would definetley recommend..  I love this car - looks, ride, quiet, comfort and I have had absolutely no problems.I currently have 14,000 miles on it and I have had it a year.My major disappointment comes when it comes to milage my overall average mpg on this car since new is 22 mpg overall (yes I have tracked every tank). I never speed and drive very casual and this is the first car EVER that I could not achieve the advertised mpg on.I got rid of a car that would do 27 mpg all day long on the highway and 23-24 city.This car gets under 20 in town and 27-28 hwy.I ask EVERYONE I see and they all say the same thing - anyone on here that says it will do any better does not know how to track milage. 4cyl.  We have had our Malibu for a year now.The car runs well and gets very good gas mileage out on the open road.Some real problems as we see it.The temp guage that reads the outdoor temp., it is designed not to work.It will work when you get in and go to town but then it will read that same temp until you have gone over 35mph for 5 miles or 15 minuets or something like that or if your car sits for more than 3 hours.If you stay in town the whole day it will stay on the original temp of the morning even if it goes up 40 degrees.Why I ask but GM said it was designed that way.Then there is the issue of not being able to chain the car up.Also the rear head rests obstruck your view..  OK this is my second review of this car after having it for 7 months and putting almost 18000 miles on it.as stated before i owned an 09 LS and upgraded to an 11 LTZ.I liked the car enough to buy another one so that should say something.I still stand by the majority of my first review and I still love this car, but there is one major difference.GAS MILEAGE!!!The 09 had a 4 speed auto, this one has a 6 speed auto.So I should do better on gas mileage right? wrong.I drive mostly highway and got about 75 miles more on a full tank in the 09.still not bad, but chevy is flat out lying about getting 33 miles mpg.im getting 23 with 80% highway usage.otherwise great car..  This car is a pain in the A - - -. I have already voiced my dis like of the seats. And mentioned the annoying \\\"low pressure\\\" warning about the tires. After receiving and E mail advising the tire pressures are low, I check with my tire gauge and sure enough one tire has 15 lbs, another has 20 lbs., another has 12 lbs and the last has 25 lbs. WHY, WHY, WHY, WHY. !!!!!!! I have never had this problem with any car I have owned. Question:Are the tires crap?Are the wheels at fault, what is going on ?And the fuel mileage is still only 23 to 24 mpg, NOT 30 !!!!! My Nissan gets 32 mpg around town. What a piece of junk. GM should be ashamed.I have contacted GM customer service and they just .  I've had my malibu for almost a month now and it's the best car I have ever owned! I read all these reviews before I purchased and they are spot on.The thing performs like a 6 cyl and gets better gas mileage than the crummy aveo I traded in.Styling is terrific! When I pulled up to my girls house she thought it was a BMW.Few things I would change. 1st is the headroom' it's not bad when sitting in the vehicle but I often hit my head while entering. 2nd is there are no handles inside for the passengers to hold.3rd, the heated seat switch is on the seat in an awkward place.Other than that it's perfect! Tight, quiet and fun to drive...big head turner too.$25,000 for luxury at it's best!.  Bought my Malibu in January of this year.There is nothing about it that I do not like.Base model, Summit White exterior.Fantastic gas mileage. I try to focus on my driving habits and make an effort to use cruise control when possible and as result I was able to achieve 39.4 miles per gallon on a recent round-trip to Columbus OH from Indianapolis.Goal was not to exceed 65 MPH.Weekly fill-ups (40% city, 60% highway) always average 27-28 MPG. The car looks sharp inside and out.Chevy created a real winner..  I just came off a lease of a '09 Merc Milan L4 My my new Malibu is so much better in every catagory.  I purchased a a Malibu in the fall and I am very disappointed in the gas mileage, I drive mainly on the highway and only receive around 24 to 25 miles per gallon.I purchase this vehicle for the good gas mileage and chevy isn't standing behind their advertisements of 23 city to 33 highway..  I bought an LS in 2009 and it was a great car.Took a few thousand miles to get the good gas milage but it was great to have even for a basic car.Well chevy was offering some great deals on the 2011s so I decided to upgrade to a fully loaded 2011 LTZ.I couldn't be happier.It's fun to drive even for a 4 banger and looks good on the road or sitting in the parking lot.The 09 had a 4 speed auto and this one has a 6 speed auto, so it does feel a little different on shifts and sometimes will lag between shifts but overall I just love this car.Recommend to anyone..  This car is a delight to drive.I have had a malibu before and went to a HHR [no where near as nice].I went back to a malibu this year .I could not pass up the deal i got with the rebate ,credit union discount and previous owner discount.It took a while [2,000 miles] to gain thegood gas mpg .On the highway in cruise i get 35mpg with the 4 banger.Has plenty of power and rides smooth.Looks rich with the mocha exterior and cocoa/cashmere interior.I am a happy puppy with it .i hope it continues with no problems .I again say its a delightfull dish [car].  A very comfortable car with good handling, decent power,and excellent economy.Have about 6000 miles on the odometer and have gotten up to 37 mpg (at 5 mph over freeway speeds) using a light throttle and cruise control.Very good in ice and snow here in the Northeast..  Great looking car ,love to drive everyday!! .  I just bought my first Malibu about a week ago and I am quite impressed at this vehicle. I really like the design of this car. I was never impressed with the older Malibu style but GM did a nice job on this body style. I must say that it has a \\\"big car\\\" ride and the 2.4 litre 4 cyl. engine puts out a fair amount power. I am over six feet tall and I have ample headroom..  very nice car, surprised at power and overall ride control,love the white diamond paint and the way it handles in ice and snow. Overall very nice car, and impressed wit it more everyday. .  So this is our second Chevrolet. Our first was the umpteenth generation of the Suburban (a 2007). It was an awesome vehicle. Amazingly reliable. So, after our lease was up we decided to try another. With a focus on fuel economy we decided to go with the Malibu. We love this car so far it is very nice and comfortable. Extremely Quiet and the ride is very strong. We love the power of the 4 cylinder and are very impressed with the styling. Love this CAR! GM, you have won us over. .  I purchased My Malibu to save money on fuel, and have a comfortable ride. My first stop for gas netted me over 32MPG. This car is very comfortable for me (6'3\\\" and over 280lbs), although the door opening could be a little larger.I am finding the 2.4 4cyl engine to be adequate, but if you want the good MPG, you need to drive it light there is an egg between your foot and the gas pedal..  After looking at all the competition, we bough a 2008 Malibu and put 50,000 miles on it. Last week the car was totaled in an accident.The safety systems performed well. We did another review of the 2011 competition, again the answer was Malibu. Hard to beat the features performance and price..  I shopped Nissan, Hyundai, Toyota, Ford Escape, an used Mercedes Benz. After driving the Mercedes (2004 model), my daughter tried Malibu. She can hardly hear the engine.  The car is smooth and GM dealership behaved as if they were a Lexus dealership. The deal of Malibu in Black Friday was amazing. It seems GM changed the money factors that day.  The car is beautiful looking, with power. It has some indescribable feeling of exhilaration while driving it. A state of bliss that no Malibu in the past offered. It awakens self-confidence in drivers who feel much richer and free. Its a car for the young, suddenly. It help you aim high and see possible what one thought impossible before..  I find this to be a very comfortable and quite car. It handles very well and I think it also looks very good. It also has very good mpg. I drive around 70 miles every day and this car makes the drive very pleasant. As a whole, I am very happy with this car and will certainly recommend it..  The car is new, so too soon to tell if it will stand up to the test of time. I like the look of the car. Seats not great, could be more comfortable. Love the on star feature. When I needed help with getting a spare the Chevy dealership, and the Chevy corporate headquarters was very unresponsive. I would hate to have to deal with them over a really serious issue, they just don't seem to care once your out the door and they have your money. .  I just brought my car. I am in love. I was going for an 08 2lt, however i left with an 2011 1LT with a sunroof in blue. .  Just purchased in October 2010. A very pleasant and quiet driving experience especially on smooth roads. Much less quiet on bumpy roads. The car handles beautifully. I am already getting 5 MPH better overall than with my 2003 Buick and i am looking forward for even better mileage as i break it in. Average now is 27 MPG. The bucket seats are not as soft as i am used to but i think i can get used to them. Bluetooth and on star are excellent features and i am already using them.\",\n          \" Be sure to check Warranty package.  This is a really great car for the price point. Remember that this is an entry level economy car. Keeping that criteria in mind and you will not find a better value considering the 10 year warranty. No other manufacturer is standing by that long to keep your car running tops. The one issue I have found is that the fuel mileage is not as good as it should be for a 1.6L 4cyl. Mine is the 6 speed automatic and I average 27-30 mpg with a mix of driving. If you drive really easy and with great care, you can get the average up to 30-33 mpg. That is a lot less than is shown on the sticker. I can still say that it is very nice car for running around town and will hold quite a bit of storage when the seats are folded down. No regrets on this little car so far. I have put about 22K miles on it..  The trunk space isn't the best, but besides that its been a great car..  The seatbelt has a bulge that rubs against your left leg causing leg injury ..  Yes it's green!  Great car!  Quiet.  Great pickup on sport mode.  Dealership worked to get me great deal..  My wife first had a 2010 Soul and traded it on a new new 2012 VW Beetle.  We traded that in a year later on a 2014 Soul ! for her and one for me.  We really liked those cars but are always looking at others.  Traded them in on 2 Chevy Trax, the top model.  Then about a year and half went back to to the Souls.  One for each  of us and we are not going to change.  Easy in and out, more elbow room than the Trax and more storage room.  Love and use the under floor storage in the back.  Don't feel cramped in the seats which are very comfortable.  Our trip via car to Las Vegas from Minnesota was very nice.  The 200 hp engine in the ! was not taxed by the Rockies. No extreme down-shifting when going up the mountains.  Carried all our luggage (and we have a lot because we are gone for 10 days and all our electronics,pills and food.  The touch screen radio and navigation and climate controls are easy to use (we are 68 and 70 years old.)  Gas mileage around town is consistently 24 to 25 MPG and highway runs 31 or so.  Most of the Souls we see on the road or in town are driven by older people who need easy in and out and all the other features..  I get decent mileage but the MPG estimate on the dash consistently over-estimates by 5-10% (versus actual miles driven at each fill-up). The Bluetooth button on the 2017 model is actually a Siri button, so if you don't have an iPhone, it does absolutely nothing. Hands-free on an Android is limited to only answering an incoming call or calling the last phone number in your history..  Car was a rental while on vacation and fell in love with it. Easy to get in and out of and handled like a dream. Gas mileage was good and car was very quiet. Glad I got a chance to drive it and would definitely consider buying..  Tired of having to squirm and twist to get in and out of your car?  Try that in a Soul.  Then take it for a drive.  Convinced me. Long warranty from factory helped, too..  I have a three year lease on a 2017 Soul. I have owned the vehicle for just a few weeks now. In that time I have made the following observations. It is important to keep in mind that this is a base vehicle. I see it filling a niche was owned by the VW Bug, with technology and comfort. My 1.6 130 hp with an automatic transmission is plenty of motor for this car. The mileage is amazing and I love all the technology that tells me about my consumption and range.  I find that I drive a bit slower in this vehicle for some reason. Getting in and out are important to me and this is done with ease. I wish the front seat had a few more adjustments but it is fairly comfortable. The Soul is easy to drive and the ergonomics are good. The technology is easy to understand and use for an older driver like me, love the Bluetooth.. This vehicle is easy to park and navigate well in tighter areas. The one real knock on the Soul is that its smaller windows create very dangerous blind spots. If you don't have a warning system and I don't, the passenger side has a huge driver's blind spot. The drivers side is also bad but not as bad. Overall I am delighted with my KIA Soul..  This car has most of the things I wanted in a vehicle all put into one.  I had been searching and test drove quite a few vehicles and walked away from each disappointed about something.  That was not the case with this one.  The ride is smooth and the EXCLAIM is very quick.  I used to drive a smaller hatchback and got tired of having essentially fall into my car.  With the soul, the seats are at waist height and I quite literally just walk into my seat.  Just yesterday, I took a friend out in it who owns a truck and he mentioned this very thing.  He was saying he has to climb up into his truck and loves that you can just walk into the seat.  I said the same thing regarding my golf (as you just read).  I also got the Tech Package and I am very pleased with the sound system.  It is superb.  Definitely not a miss there.  The audio controls actually make sense and is very easy to navigate.  I test drove some cars that were just way too complicated (looking at you Honda).  We don't want complicated while we're driving.  I want to push 2 buttons max to get where I want and do what I want.  The fuel economy is actually lower than advertised, and that's kind of a bummer.  I drive mostly (that's 90%) interstate and am lucky if I break 28 overall.  The A/C unit is not what I'd call amazing.  There are definitely better A/C units out there.  Other than that... very comfortable.  Drives great.  Turns on a dime (better than my Hatchback did, but the hatchback handled like a dream... cuz it's a hatchback).  I am not at all disappointed and would highly recommend it.  Also, Kia's warranty kind of tells a story of a company who's not afraid to offer a high warranty because they have faith in their product.  Seriously, their warranty is twice as good as anyone else's.  Highly recommended..  I now own two Kia Souls - The first one (2013) was so impressive in build quality I bought a second upon reading the 2017 reviews. When Car and Driver and Road and Track give a 4.5 out of 5 stars - one pays attention. The 2017 I own Is simply amazing in build quality, ride handling and amenities ...... No comparison out there especially considering price..  had a 2012 soul and traded in for a 2017 model.  Not many changes between the years, except 2017 does not come with a cd player standard.  Still no spare tire.  new car has the nitrogen filled tires.  I like the car for the handling, and overall comfort. but its overpriced..  I've always liked the Kia Souls but never got one because I felt they were under powered. Enter the 2017 Kia Soul ! and its 1.6L turbo engine. The engine isn't the problem with this car. The problem is that it is only available on the Exclaim model and the Exclaim has added and subtracted a few things. They've added a red strip that goes around the bottom of the exterior and gave the interior Leather/cloth seats with orange stitching. They didn't make the Soul a race car by any means, they just added an engine that gave it enough power not to feel like you had to floor it everywhere you went. So why would they make it like a kids toy and add stupid little things like that? On to the list of things that are gone.  The front cooled seats are no longer an option and the heated front seats are still there but  now only have 2 heat settings instead of 3. Those items are still available on the Soul +. So instead of getting the Soul ! that used to be the top trim level you're getting a Soul ! that isn't even fully loaded. Still, it is a great car Kia just needs to figure out their color schemes and option availability.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":70}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_manufacturer_year_base_model_customer_review.iloc[\n","    4672,  df_manufacturer_year_base_model_customer_review.columns.get_loc('customer_review')]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":105},"id":"oUnAJHYyRfvV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711026721213,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":347,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Zhvanskiy","userId":"11978303123960557609"}},"outputId":"03fa88e0-7928-44a0-d6e3-8ef08ff5167b"},"execution_count":71,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["' Biggest of the mid size suvs. The seats are the best of all the european cars. This suv has super visibility, ride, comfort, handling and even performance. It gets over 20 mpg on the highway. If it had a 6 or 8 speed transmission  it would come close to today\\'s vehicles.  This the BEST CAR EVER for my family..  We bought this car from an original owner with about 90,000 miles on it. I had read about the transmission issues but this car had just had a complete transmission replacement from Volvo at 87,000 miles. We felt like we would get another 100k or so out of the replacement. Turns out we were wrong. At 130k the transmission started slipping and we traded it in on a new car. During the 40k miles we owned it we also had to replace the rear bearings and the front drivers side drive shaft. We also put a new headliner in. When it was running it was a great riding car. Handled snow great and was a beautiful car. Just too many issues that cost $$$.  158000 and running strong well kept maintenance done regularly nice smooth rides good for young kids GPS is a plus back up system great has been a dependable vehicle as long as you keep meaning sometime and check for the normal wear car will last you a long time.  Oh boy, let\\'s see, bought the 2004 xc90 T6 last year 2014 with only 72K miles on it,good deal right!? WRONG! The transmission \"fell out\" about 3 months after owning it.  We had a HUGE thunderstorm, which lead to a flood in the Volvo due to the seal on the sunroof needed to be cleaned.  Back Breaks and drums needed to be replaced a few months later.  Then no real problems for about 6 months, and then it wouldn\\'t start. The techs couldn\\'t figure out why? Put in a new started, bought a new key, and it still wasn\\'t starting, 11 months later, GOT RID OF IT!  Traded it in .. I wasted close to $7,000 plus in repairs, and lost on it when I traded it in. DO NOT BUY the T6 I should of done my research.  Have had this thing now for 10+ years and 90,000 miles.Went from primary car for hauling two kids to a third car that sits outside and is reserved for \"dirty work\".Have been lucky enough to avoid any engine and transmission problems but the cost of multiple failed wheel bearings, sway bars, and ignition coils have really mounted - especially for a relatively low-mileage vehicle.Still, the fact that we still have this car says a lot about it. It is extremely versatile, in terms of hauling people and stuff.It has always started and never broken down.And one thing about the Swedes - they know how to make safe cars that can drive through snow!Ten years old and does not look dated..  Wow, this is a great car to drive, unfortunately, everything breaks on it.I normally don\\'t post, but I just had to register to let people know.Here is the short list of things:2004 T6, first owner: Front (both) and rear (both x 2) shock mounts (not shocks, the stupid plastic pieces they put in there). Motors in the dash for the air. Replaced two of them now.$$$ Driver window motor.$$The rain drains on the roof got plugged up, when they overflow, it goes onto one of the computers on the driver side.$$$Turbo is now dead $2000, and the traction/stability computer is dead.$$$ Rear wheel bearings $$ plus the tires they ruined.I won\\'t own another volvo, ever..  Do Not buy this car!I was enamored by the nice look, the safey reputation, and the fun drive of this car.And despite warnings on this and other review sites, I went ahead and bought it.I got a used one for $10k.After a year of in-and-out of the mechanic, and countless $$\\'s spent on repairs, I finally junked it when the last repair estimate came to $11k.You would not believe how many \"car experts\" asked me how stupid I was to buy that car.Big...waste...of...money!Please do not buy this car.Don\\'t be tempted like I was.You will regret it.I guarantee..  Bought a used xc90 from volvo. We have averaged a new problem every 2000 miles. Including a breakdown leaving my pregnant wife stranded and now flickering headlights that cant be fixed despite visits to the dealership and throwing money at it. (computers and modules are next on the list) It would be nice if the dealership looked like they knew how to fix what is apparantly a common problem on their vehicles... So its going to be traded in with a 6 mth loss of 5-6k. Looks pretty but its not engineered well nor built well - certainly not the volvos of old. .  I bought my xc90 used and the problems didn\\'t start til about 85k miles. Then I started having to replace wheel bearings, control arms, and ball joints. Then my car hit 100k miles and literally as soon as the odometer rolled over, my driver side headlight went out due to an electrical issue, then the alternator went, battery needed replaced, serpintine belt, timing belt, tempeture gauge housing, crank shaft assembly, and now at 101k miles on my way to look for a new car, my car starts smoking and my turbo blew which on the t6 is a twin turbo. I have been towed 3x in 3 weeks and everytime I go to get rid of it something else goes. I am having it junked and taking a loss on what I still owe..  VOLVO YOU HAVE SOLD A LEMON TO YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS AND THAT WILL CAUSE YOU TO SUFFER GREATLY. This 2004 Volvo xc90 has been a nightmare for me. I spent over $2600 dollars this summer and it continues to add on up.my dash board turns off and i lose power to the rear of the vehicle. This makes this AWD car become FWD!! doesnt make sense but its true and i cant even open my gas door and i have to open it manually from inside. THIS IS THE WORST CAR!! Yesterday the tail light on the passenger went out and some of my front right lights too. \"multiple bulbs failure\" today i start it and they are all working. WHY do this to your customer VOLVO! VOLVO IS LIFELESS!!! .  We loved our 2004 T6 until yesterday when we had to be towed from Lake Tahoe to a Sacramento Volvo Dealer ( 109 miles ). Two different dealers told me this model has a huge transmission problem. There is talk of a law suit on the discussion board as so many owners have had problems. To be fair, some of the owners got full replacement including trnsmission, lines and radiator (around $7000 n). We\\'ll see how it goes ....  Absolutely love this SUV. Best vehicle I have ever own, hands down. Safe. Reliable. Kid friendly. Just all sound great SUV..  I have an 04 Volvo XC90 and had the bad experience of the Transmission Service Urgent light coming on and the vehicle putting itself into \"limp mode\" to stop further damage.  Of all the blogs I read after this happened, most of them had negative outcomes as far as support from Volvo.  I had a great experience and wanted to share that Volvo covered 100% of my damages.  I am getting a new transmission, new radiator and new lines installed.  I called Volvo\\'s customer service line.  I was assigned a customer care rep that was extremely pleasant and helpful.  She worked with the Volvo dealer and I had a response in 2 hours of the 100% coverage including the diagnostic fee.  Volvo: 1-800-458-1552.  Volvo is Swedish for junk. Worst car I have ever owned. Horrible service - Constantly breaking down. Needs a new transmission at less than 60,000 miles. New Turbo\\'s. New head gasket. Burns through tires, oil, and brake pads, latches and locks have broken.  If you are looking to be unhappy about your ride it is the car for you!  Remember, friends don\\'t let friends by Volvos!  If you buy one of these cars there is one of you born every second (sucker) otherwise Volvo would go the way of Dodo bird..  From the beginning gas leak inside the car repaired by dealer. General western warranty all but worthless on most costly parts. Spring seats not covered. Electronic module not covered ABS not covered. Cost thousand of dollars. Every maintenance check is $400 or more, and you must maintain or waste warranty. Is that reliability in our auto world today?.  We bought our 2004 xc90 nov. 2007 with 57,000 and it has been a great SUV. Very strong but when the transmission light went on at 87,000 I was not a happy customer. We called the Volvo dealer and they told us to bring it in. They were very helpful and we have a \"brand new\" transmission at no cost, yet it doesn\\'t have \"manual\" anymore. a lot of drama but it\\'s driving well and I cant complain .  I would not buy this vehicle again.  Have replaced almost the entire suspension of the this vehicle and the transmission failed twice, once at 60K miles and again 6 months later.  As other customers have said, the customer service was awful.  .  This vehicle is hands down the most elegant, smooth, and did I say smooth vehicle I have ever driven. The seats are so comfy, and the steering wheel just feels like silk! But then the transmission issue. Do not buy a t6 awd unless it has had the transmission upgrade! I bought one used now I\\'m looking at $8,000.00 in repairs. Volvo knows it\\'s a huge prob and will pay for parts in some cases. .  I hate this car! Bought new, all options but the GPS, over $50K. At 200 miles needed a new fuel tank, original was cracked. Here\\'s what went wrong: Xenon headlight fogged replaced, almost killed myself because they were pointing down, night visibility after reinstall of the new ones was 10 feet! Then the tail lights leaked filled with water, replaced, power steering unit, replaced, computer replaced, fuel tank door fell off 2X\\'s, windshield wipers broke, CD player and back-up signal beeper stopped working, brakes after 20K miles, tires every 22K miles, water filled the roof, wanted $900 to remove interior to let it \"dry out\"! Suspension bushings needed replacement, & on & on. I HATE IT!.  I purchased this vehicle used with 107,000 miles. I should have checked Edmunds reviews 1st. At 117,000 miles, just like previous reviews - transmission problems. Cost for replacement, $6,000 and only a one year warranty. .  My 04, XC90 is a tank; in a good way.  Handles great in the snow and any wet weather and most assuredly can tear up the pavement.  The third row seating could use more room, but after all it is a midsized suv.  This is my 5th Volvo and 7th in two generations.  I have 167,765 miles on my vehicle with the original transmission and turbos.  Tires have come and gone, but the brakes have only been replaced once. As far as cost of upkeep...I bought a Volvo. No one who buys a Benz complains about price. .  I\\'ve bought my 04 XC90 believing the car was reliable. Later to find out the first month I had it the transmission light appear. the transmission had to be replaced a long with the radiator and later the radio had to be replace as well next the driver side window track had to be replaced then the doors would open while driving on it\\'s own while locked. A few months later the steering wheel became loose, it cost me ninty dollars to have it tighten.  The transmission I can some what understand because it was made by GM. I thought I bought a car without an American part. Unfortunately not so. This will haunt me for the life of this car. The brakes and tires well it\\'s a heavy car big deal!.  Do NOT, NOT buy this model. I got it with little more than 80Kmiles, for less than 3 months and I am experiencing severe transmission problems. I made some research about this type of problem and it seems that most XC90s, specially 2005 and early have this transmission problem. The worst part is that the warranty I bought it with, will not cover until after 90days of the purchase. It was a good car until the transmission issue experience. .  My fiance\\'s 2004 T6 AWD Volvo has 250,000 miles and it drives like it\\'s brand new. It\\'s had no problems (just regular maintenance). He changes the oil regularly and uses premium gas. His dad (a small business owner) has two newer Volvos he purchased as company cars that have also racked up some miles, and they also drive wonderfully. My fiance and his dad absolutely love Volvo XC90\\'s and this lead me to purchase one for myself. I recently bought a used 2004 2.5T FWD with 53,000 miles and I love it so far. I hope she also makes it to 250,000!.  Overall I had an excellent experience with my Volvo XC90.  I had some of the same issues in that I had to replace the brake pads and tires frequently, but I do mostly city driving with a lot of stop and go.  I had no major problems until December of 2009.  The check engine light went on.  It was time for the 60,000 mile tune-up and when they changed the spark plugs and coil, everything was fine for about 2 weeks. Then the engine light came back on.  It took an overnight stay and a cold start for them to find the issue;a cracked gasket head!!  There had been no warning signs, no running it hot, nothing!  The repair cost of $6000 made me decide to trade it for the new XC60 T6 AWD. I miss it :(.  I am the original owner of this car.  We paid MSRP (I know, I know).  The car is loaded and was fabulous for about a year.  We have had to replace all four tires 4 times, brakes 4 times, transmission, rear bearings.. engine problems, key fob problems, seat belt problem, water leaking...  You name it, we\\'ve had it.  The ONLY thing we did right was buy the extended warranty. Has saved us $10k, easily..  My wife and I ordered our XC-90 through a local dealership then went over to Sweden to test drive it for a week. Volvo shipped it back for us 10 days later. The vehicle has been perfect for the past 6 years. I am however, quite concerned with all the negative reviews here. Of all the vehicles I\\'ve owned throughout my life, I must admit that this XC-90 beats them all by far..  Do not buy this year xc90 under ANY circumstances. Had it one and a half months, transmission exploded. Car has low miles (45,000) and I bought the aftermarket warranty. They will not cover the loss due to a clip failure in the transmission, which fails due to a too short lube tube from the pan. Thumbs way down. .  This car looks great, seats 7 semi- comfortably, is great in the snow, and will spend as much time in the shop as on the road.  O2 sensors out at 50k. Spark plugs needed replaced at 50k.  Transmission needed replaced at 61k.  Volvo service won\\'t stand behind the car.  I was told directly that \"Volvo for life\" is \"Just a slogan.\"  Don\\'t let the pretty looks and solid reputation fool you.  The newer Volvos are trouble.  Expensive trouble at that..  Worst and final Volvo I will own. I purchased i in 2007, NOTHING but trouble. Over 2,500 in repairs to front end, and then the transmission went at 79k At this point I traded it in on a Chevy Tahoe Z71. Much happier and haven\\'t had nearly as much trouble.  Volvo customer service and dealership were horrible. I have owned 4 Volvo\\'s and after this experience I will never buy Volvo again. Nothing but problems. VERY dissatisfied..  I really like my XC90. While it has had some minor issues, overall it has been a pleasure to own.  After driving this vehicle in LA, i got rear ended badly (the Lexus was totaled that hit me) and my XC90 was a tank. I can\\'t say enough good things about his vehicle.  .  We bought  this car new. This has been my favorite car to drive. We bought it because it had all the safety features that we wanted which were ahead of it\\'s time, it\\'s nice size, and it\\'s towing capacity. Despite the practical reasons for buying this car, it is fun! The power is incredible. It has phenomenal acceleration even at high speeds on the highway.  It is usually no contest, even against other sport sedans. I have had this car for five years and 80,000 miles.  It is the only car that I have loved for more than a couple years, and it is just as fun as the day we bought it. .  This is our 6th Volvo. Smooth and comfortable on the highway. We keep up with the maintenance and have the transmission fluid flushed annually. Best mileage was 23.4 mpg on the highway with premium 93. Most filling stations add 10% ethanol now which has lowered our fuel economy averages. .  If I had to do it all over again I wouldn\\'t. This vehicle has been nothing but problems. Brakes wear too fast, the first brake job was at 6,000 miles, I have 23,000 and need new rotors and pads. The steering makes noise and has always, I was told it was normal. Then after the warranty was up I had to have the front steering fixed, ball joints and the rack. now the steering only makes fluid noise but still a pain. The radio is the worst ever. The best part is the safety, but with the poor fuel economy, the multiple problems, the very poor resale value I should have went with the BMW. For some reason my wife wants to keep it.  I can only expect more problems as time goes on. .  I should have seen the sign. When I went to buy the car back in 2004, I had picked out the exact model I wanted, then while I was filling out paperwork, I was notified one of the doors did not open. After another Identical model was found, I took it home. 8500 miles later it needed brakes. Seats showed wear at 10000 miles. Then soon after, the passenger door started popping open. There have been numerous leaks, including a cracked power steering reservoir. Many noises started popping up, a transmission leak appeared, the Volvo dealership rarely fixed problems the first time. Now, because of this, at 47000 miles, the car is in need of a new transmission. Volvo now must replace the radiator..  This car is in the shop about once a month. Luckily we bought the extended service warranty as the build quality is on par with some of the first generation Korean models. Some the failures are real safety concerns. I guess the positive if the parts do fail and result in accident you know you will be safe.   .  Bought this car used a year ago with ~30K miles on it to replace a \\'00 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I loved the XC90. It is so fun to drive, looks great, has great options (heated seats, navi, dvd, wood steering wheel, etc), was comfortable to sit in, and had no big problems. Only in the shop once when I thought it was making a funny noise. Dealership was great, it was still under warranty so they fixed noise and a couple other things (stereo light had gone out).  Had two kids with car seats in the 2nd row.  Access to the 3rd row was hard, but you really can\\'t fit a human being in the 3rd row anyway. Better to keep the 3rd row down for more cargo room. Sadly totaled this car but it kept us safe!'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":71}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##

They have all been excellent cars. The gas mileage of the first three has been acceptable. I was not prepared for the disastrous mileage of my xc90. It has a T-5 engine (five cylinder). My average mileage is 12.5 miles per gallon. It is obvious to me that I cannot keep this car. The comfort, style, and performance are outstanding, but I can\\'t afford the mileage. I have done everything to put the car in tip-top shape, even the sparkplugs which cost $25 each. The motor performs well, and is extremely smooth. My only hope is that the software can be updated to give me better mileage. And this is more of a wish than a hope. No, I didn\\'t do \\'due diligence\\' when I bought this car, because of the great experience of my prior Volvos.  I know I\\'ll lose money trading, but I\\'ll lose more money keeping this particular car. My wife and I are up in the years, and this was to be our last car; but it will be, I hope, our next to lat car. I can\\'t wait to trade. I can get a luxury car with better mileage. But I will inquire about the software which might help the mileage before trading. A sad story .....  Easy to maintain. Safest car I\\'ve ever own..  It\\'s with a heavy heart that I pass my car on to my son who needs it in college.  This is been a great car, very comfortable, reliable and it\\'s held up well over 10 years and three kids.  Only wish Volvo have not priced the new 2016 XC 90s so high. Had to move to Honda pilot..  We bought this vehicle at least 4 years ago. Love it. We\\'d get another one. I didn\\'t rate it for maintenance cost as we really haven\\'t ever had major maintenance issues beyond changing oil etc (we are just at 70K miles). At this point, we\\'d buy an updated version when this one wears out. The 2.5L Turbo engine has plenty of power for us..  I bought it mostly for work and trips to Florida.  So far a great car, plenty of get up and go. The spacious interior and driver conforts were just what I was looking for. Now I have put 60K miles on it, I still very much like this car. A few Maintenance issues that took i care of myself but most people would have taken to a shop.( Struts,brakes,timing Belt And Plugs\\\\coil Packs)At 156000 And Take It On Long Trips Frequently. Very Reliable And A Pleasure To Drive. Does Very Well In Snow..  I bought a \\'06 in 2013 and drove it 2 years before rear ending someone.   The car fell apart as it should have but kept us all safe.  It was a great road trip car being very comfortable and managed to hold camping gear for a family of four.  Be ready to find an independent mechanic to fix some moderate to expensive repairs but this is a great car..  Over 1/2 the cars we\\'ve owned have been Volvo...This one will change that. This has had constant noise in the form of clunks, squeals and rattles. There is always an error light or message on and we\\'ve spent a small fortune on parts. I\\'m a certified ASE mechanic and do all my own work but this has been a challenge. New rack and pinion, new exhaust, new struts, new springs, new tie rod ends, new radiator, new pulleys and new tires every 15K. This thing cant keep tires or brakes! The gas mileage is great, the power wonderful but everything else failed. The stereo is substandard and no one will touch it for aftermarket because of Volvos proprietary computers. The mirror trim has fallen off, the light dimmer/turn signal indicator fell off, windows get stuck. In short, this has left my wife stranded more then any vehicle she\\'s owned. Tried to talk with dealership about issues but they create even more...worst dealer we\\'ve ever worked with. Tried to talk with Volvo and they didn\\'t care. You can get a lemon but when the dealer and the manufacture wont help and in fact, exasperate the situation, it tells you it\\'s time to move on. We\\'re shopping for two new vehicles and wouldn\\'t consider owning another Volvo. We actually bought a 2012 BMW X3. It\\'s the best vehicle I\\'ve ever owned. Customer support is off the charts compared to Volvo and the vehicle arnt even in the same league! I\\'m angry at myself for waiting so long to get rid of Volvo...you really can enjoy your SUV.  I purchased my XC90 2.5T in March of 2013 with 74K miles. It is the third Volvo that I have owned and is by far my favorite. I traded in my 2004 S60 to buy the XC90. Many people say that the 2.5T engine is underpowered, but I feel that its 208hp feels peppy and is perfectly matched to the transmission. The handling feels confident and the seats are very comfortable. As far as cargo spaces is concerned, I am pleased.Fuel economy is decent for a vehicle of its size. I average about 17 in town and 23-24 on the highway. The cabin is quiet and the interior is composed of high quality materials. My vehicle has the optional navigation system, which is nice, but inputting information can be an annoyance.Update** It is now three years later and I will say that buying a used XC90 was a great decision.  I now have 111K miles on my XC90 and I have been impressed with the reliability of the vehicle.  I recently visited the Volvo dealership for regular scheduled maintenance (replacement of the timing belt and drive belt) and spent about $750 for that service.  When the dealership completed the maintenance inspection during the visit, they were unable to find anything that needed to be replaced or repaired. They key to buying a used Volvo is to ensure you buy it from a Volvo dealer and research the maintenance history of the vehicle. Aside from buying tires and having oil changes, the most I have spent on the vehicle has been for the timing and drive belt service. I have not had a single issue. It is my hope that I am able to put 200,000 miles on my XC90.  Once I am done with this one, I do plan on buying another XC90 or an XC60. When it comes to safety, reliability, and quality, I find it hard to beat. It is an excellent road trip vehicle and is the perfect size to accommodate passengers and cargo. I do wish the fuel economy was a little better, but I do have to keep in mind that for a 2006, it falls in the more fuel efficient range of most SUV\\'s for that time.  As a final note, if you are looking for a used XC90 for whatever reason, it is best to stay away from the T6 (2.9 liter I-6 cylinder turbo engine) variants made from 2003-2005 and the V8 engines.  The 2.5T\\'s (I-5 cylinder turbo engines) were discontinued in 2006 and did not suffer from the transmission issues of the T6 and V8 engines. The years 2007+ models with the 3.2 I-6 cylinder engines are also very reliable. I mentioned this in my review a three years ago, but it bears repeating since I can\\'t stress it enough :-).  My XC-90 is horrible, front to back.Friends don\\x92t let friends buy volvo\\x92s. Treatment from the volvo dealerships in Houston is horrible, unless you are super rich, they will certainly hook you up, otherwise, bring your checkbook.You pay out the nose to own a volvo. My xc-90? 3 sets of wheel bearings burned out, the rear end went out, the fuel pump has already been replaced, the CURRENT check engine light issue will cost me $1,000, just put $1,500 into it to get the steering column to work again, the Houston dealership seriously jacked me over. you HAVE to take it to the dealership. They know they\\'ve got you by the throat. OBTW, my windshield leaks. Headlights fogged from inside. $500 each.  Purchased a used 2006 Volvo XC90 AWD V8 a year ago, had 77K miles on it, but was in excellent condition and we thought very safe for our family.We didn\\'t know it had a transmission that COULD NOT be repaired ONLY REPLACED.The Volvo dealership informed us that this particular transmission was not repairable.Unfortunately our warranty company wouldn\\'t ok the replacement so we had to transfer the car to a transmission repair facility to try and rebuild it.They were able to get all the parts needed but 1 and Volvo wouldn\\'t sell the 1 part that would fix our car.SO we had to purchase a USED transmission for $5,700.00 (new would have been $7,500)..  I\\'ve had this car for almost 6 years.It\\'s had a few minor annoying problems that were mostly covered under the warrenty until it hit 80KThe warrenty is now up and it\\'s been a royal pain.I have an AWD 6 cyl. turbo that has 90,000 miles on it.This is my 2nd Volvo and we currently own 2 XC90\\'s so we have double the pain....Issues have been the anti skid sensor- $700 plus to fix, burns through tires in about 30k miles with easy, gentle driving.New issue is my wheel bearings are shot.My husband has a 2005 what we just spent about $3,000 on new tie rods, new bearings, new e-brake, new oil pump, leaking in oil system and after all that his check engine light is on again! .  Bought this car Aug.2009 and 98,000kms but still good condition,I drove from calgary to winnipeg, and its fun to drive,it\\'s only 2.5 cylynder but good in the highway,I love it....  Bought this car used from the local Volvo dealer.  With only 38,000kms on it & half the price of a new one it seemed like a no brainer. It also came with the entertainment package & third row seating. I want to love this car. I think it is the best looking SUV out there. It handles beautifully it\\'s unassuming & overall a great family vehicle. But. I can\\'t get over how loud the engine is, and how poorly it accelerates. Go up a slight incline it sounds like the transmission is slipping. Coming down a decline, it does the same thing and clunks into gear. It really bothers me.  I keep thinking it has transmission problems.  Also, at 2500 rpm it revs really loud! It\\'s being traded in for an LR4..  We purchased my Volvo used in 2007 and it had 36,000 miles on it.  We had recently had our second child and loved the safety features and quality of this car.  (Not to mention it is beautiful) It came with a few flaws, poor fuel consumption and rear doors that don\\'t open wide enough in the back to get kids/groceries misc in and out.  Third row is a joke really, no room for normal sized adults.  Ok for children but hard to get them in and out.  Overall this vehicle made me happy for 3 years and we never had any repairs other than scheduled maintenance.  Just traded it in on a minivan due to our THIRD child arriving, but still missing my Volvo.  I\\'ll have another one again someday..  Great use of space. Either 7 people or lots of cargo space. I live in Colorado and the turbo provides excellent power for high altitude driving. Had some friends compare a Lexus rx with an xc90 on I-70 in the  high winds (40-50 mph and gusty) that we sometimes have on the front range, and they said the xc90 was vastly superior. Don\\'t know about the Lexus but my xc90 handles these winds like no other car I\\'ve ever driven..  110k mi & still drives fantastic! Smooth, powerful, tight handling & fun to drive. Happy with whole drivetrain.  Only problem so far was the \"infotainment software bug,\" which was fixed with quick update @ dealer.  DON\\'T get turbo model with \"garbage\" GM transmission. The V8\\'s avg 1mpg gas penalty is worth every drop!  \\'05+ Yamaha V8 model has better Aisan Warner 6-speed & nice AWD system.  Did i mention the significant testicular fortitude?.  We bought this car about 6 weeks ago & I really love it. It fits my kids\\' two car seats easily & will fit a third - all in the second row. I\\'ve read that it doesn\\'t have that great of pick up when you accelerate, but I haven\\'t found that to be the case at all. Drives great, love the sunroof, really love that the backseat has a/c vents for the kids! It is without a doubt the best car I\\'ve ever driven (have previously owned Chevys & an Acura). .  I bought this car used in Nov of 2008 and have had it for almost a year and a half.  I have not had one problem with this car.  I am very pleased with the performance.  The gas mileage could be better but i knew that going in.  The interior does not have enough space for all my stuff but I manage.  I really love driving this car and feel very safe in it. .  All around solid vehicle. It\\'s an Ocean Race Edition, but with the 5-cylinder engine (that\\'s how it was packaged in Canada). You only need a V8 if you plan on towing. Drive it in and around Calgary, which gets a wide range of weather conditions. The AWD is particularly impressive in the rain and snow (winter tires are necessary for half the year, of course). Other than routine scheduled maintenance, have only had a couple of fixes (head light and wheel bearing) which were covered under warranty..  We bought ours as a certified pre-owned vehicle and have had no problems what so ever since purchase. Overall the fit and finish of the XC90 is very good and reliability is excellent.The 2.5T is not a powerhouse of an engine, but on the highway and around town its adequate. It\\'s a good,safe family car..  This was a 40th birthday present..worst $$ ever spent. fuel pump went out first yr. stranded in the middle of nowhere literally..3 recalls, middle console makes noise, front end steering makes popping noise (took many trips to fix) grinding noise in reverse, many trips to figure this out, side window leaks, OEM tires terrible, brakes replaced every 25,000 miles, power steering pump went out, now the car is not wanting to go in reverse and the key mechanism has problems, fuel door latch broke ($350 to fix) we are now cutting our losses and trading it for a GMC SLT Yukon, only 58,000 miles on this money pit!! Spend your $42K elsewhere!!.  I\\'ve decided to write an objective review.  I\\'ve had the opportunity to own numerous cars/truck/suv\\'s in my lifetime.  The XC-90 first of all is an outstanding ride.  I drove it all the way from Arizona to Alabama and have driven it on short trips as well.  It\\'s a great \"in-town\" SUV and the saftey features make you feel very secure while driving it.  The interior is sub-par, and most items feel flimsy.  The center console \"creaks\" whenever you touch it and the dials are a little childish looking.  But, with that the ride is awesome and the service (only every 7500 miles) lets you know you\\'re driving a Volvo..  We bought this Volvo one summer and have been loving it ever since. The car is very spacious and is very kid proof. If you have small children it is great because its got a built in booster seat and moves forward so the parts and reach the child easier. The XC90 5 Cylinder can be slow at times but when you step on it, it goes and handles very well. The rides very smooth and for the price comes with so many options. You can pay 10000 more for a BMW X5 with all the same features but not the same safety. .  We\\'ve had the XC90 since Dec. 05 and have only performed scheduled maintenance. Comfort, safety, and reliability have been excellent. .  This is my wife\\'s vehicle, which she loves. I am less enthusiastic, as I wish it were more reliable. So far in less than 2 years of having the vehicle, there have been 5 recalls. We have had a dead battery requiring the vehicle to be towed (bad cell). We have had a rear wheel bearing go bad. Both of these occurred at under the 17k currently on it. Factory Pirelli Scorpion zero tires practically bald at less than 12k and replaced on my dime..  Got this car for thousands off because I bought it in 2007 when it was a 2006 model, but it was new. Very happy with the looks outside and inside. After a 5 months I had some problems, some anti-skid message that kept coming up, they said it was a computer problem but it happened twice. Possibly due to extremely horrible speed bumps where I live the car began making weird clicks when the gas/brakes were pressed; brake pads, alignment, sub-frame, etc all needed work. Right window makes whistling noise. DVD system headphones sound fuzzy sometimes. Very fast for an SUV, and I always feel safe..  Great car for the first couple of weeks. Then it would not accelerate. It took four trips to the dealer, and me having to drive the car for them. They had to change the fuel tank, and pump. Lots of noises and clunks, that they can\\'t fix..  This is our second xc90, we loved our 2004, but we wanted the rear entertainment package, so we traded for a 2006 with everthing. After looking at some other SUVs recently due to co-workers buying new ones I wouldn\\'t trade mine for anything else I\\'ve seen out yet..  I\\'ve had my \\'06 for 16 months now but before that had an 05.  Just test drove an ML 350 from Mercedes and I must say I prefer my Volvo. Granted the ML had a few features that were nice but overall, my Volvo had much more comfortable seats and more features for the price, i.e. dvd system, memory driver\\'s seat, etc. I also have much more cargo area in my Volvo and because it\\'s a bigger car I have more legroom and just feel safer. Close the doors on the Mercedes and do the same with the Volvo and you\\'ll know the difference. My only gripe so far with the Volvo is the cheaply made stereo speaker units in the front corners. Should be better for a 50K+ vehicle..  An excellent car, firm ride.  You have the feeling of being in a safe car.  Goes through snow with ease. Very good handling.  I recommend this car to anyone who wants a safe car.  Gas mileage is a bit off and the gas tank is relatively small for a car of this size..  I love the ride but it has died in the middle of a busy intersection twice. It had to be towed back to the dealership and they replaced the fuel pump and we are waiting to see what they think it is this time. The driver\\'s side beam has had to be replaced twice. The DVD system works intermittently. I thought Volvos were supposed to be dependable and safe. I have a 3 year old and I am going to have to get something else unfortunately..  This is a follow up to my first post in Aug 06 when car was new.  Just turned 10k miles and one year.  Absolutely nothing has gone wrong with the car.  Got a recall notice about the gas tank door and they fixed this during a routine service at 7,500 miles, but never suffered the problem. Took one long trip with 5 persons and gear.  It was tight but didn\\'t want to put anything on the roof.  Added a hitch (not from the dealer!) and a great bike rack from softride.  We are still loving the car.  Mileage is in the 17-18 in the city and 22-23 hwy..  I bought this car 9 months ago and have had it die 3 times on me.  The battery had died because of a software glitch (they think) as described in a technical bulletin Volvo Int. put out.  Each time the vehicle has been in my garage and when I went to start it, nothing.  I love this car but am so disappointed in the reliability.  I also think for a beautiful SUV such as this is, and not a big mammoth SUV, it should get much better gas mileage.  Our local dealership has been great but it has been extremely inconvenient to have our brand new Volvo die.  I love the way it drives, handles, its comfort, but if I have another problem, I\\'m inclined to ask Volvo Int. to take the car back.  .  I also own this vehicle because of its safety reputation. And of course my children\\'s safety is priceless. However, I\\'ve also driven the Honda Pilot and with its amenities, reliability, and 3rd row airbags, can the volvo really be worth over $10K more? If I could do it over I would have bought a Honda Pilot. .  Purchased a 2003 XC90 T6 new. Traded it in for a XC90 V8 in 2006. Totally different vehicle. Engine powerful and quiet.  No comparison with the T6.  T6 noisy, rough running and a gas hog.  V8 smooth as silk and much better MPG. Also, the T6 was a five passenger, the V8 a 7.  The V8 rides much smoother because of the self leveling rear. All in all a world class vehicle with a top IIHS safety rating. You can spend a lot more money on an SUV and I don\\'t think you can buy a much better vehicle.  Dollar for dollar an excellent investment.  .  The last OCEAN RACE EDITION in Europe. Be happy with this car like I\\'m. Nice regards from Slovenia. Branko.  Great car for the family!  I have had Mercedes, Navigator, multiple explorers...  Great car- don\\'t like the gas mileage even on the 5 cyl. and was really surprised at how poorly even with Traction Control the car was in the snow..  I have had my XC90 for just over a year now.  It\\'s the best vehicle I\\'ve ever owned but has some small drawbacks that I can overlook. The driver seat is already starting to feel as if it is wearing on the outer bolster.  Overall it handles great for its size and does better than great on the autobahn in Germany at speed.  The 6-speed tip-tronic changes are somewhat slushy during gear changes.  I still compare it to the Touareg and LR3 that my co-workers have and I find it to be a better vehicle than theirs.  Some of the options could come down in price.  Over $3k for navigation is too much.  I bought an aftermarket system for less than $600.  But you pay quality money for a quality SUV..  I had two cars b4 this and they were MB C230 and BMW Z4.  Believe it or not I don\\'t miss much of those two.  They were both great get away cars but neither were comfortable cars.  XC90 is just one extremely comfortable car to drive and I looked at Tourag seriously but it was little too small and I just couldn\\'t risk VW\\'s reliability.  I had 2002 GTI and was in shop every two weeks and lasted less than 2 yrs. My brother just bought new 2006 Passat.. stopped on next day of purchase.. Rear AC was not working and turns out vent was missing.  What a poor built quality.  Beware of VW!.  After owning Volvo\\'s for years, I tried  other brands over the last 5 years, Infinity and Lexus. This year I decided it was time to return to Volvo\\'s and purchased a 2006-XC90. It is not the Volvo I drove and loved for years!  I still like the safety aspects of the vehicle, but the dependability and feel are gone for me.  The cabin is loud and the ride is rough.  I had to have it  towed to back to the dealer two weeks after I bought it when it would not start.  I will not be a Volvo customer in the future.  The other premium brands have left them in the dust. .  I enjoy driving this vehicle and feel extremely safe in it  My only disappointment is in the gas mileage.  I traded in a Tahoe in perfect condition to get rid of the 8 cylinder engine only to get less gas mileage.  If I had know about the mileage I would have gone with the more powerful 8 cyl.Volvo as it had a smoother ride and more power on the road..  From the delivery from Neftin Volvo ( awesome dealership) the XC90 has been my favorite car ever.  Rides like a magic carpet and off roads like rhino.  I LOVE IT!.  I waited 2 yrs for this car!  Needed the suv body style,  very happy with this!  A few minor problems (computer errors).  At 25,000 miles, had to replace tires.  Not happy about that. Was told its common on Awd suvs?!  Would like to know what other owners think about this.  .  My Volvo XC90 is my new favorite automobile. I am a very particular consumer who spends a great deal of time researching before buying a new auto.  This vehicle has been my most satisfying purchase yet.  I may never leave Volvo if they keep making this vehicle! It is everything a professional mom could want...both sexy and safe! I am considering a volvo for my son when he gets his lisence soon..  We bought the car because we thought it would be useful, versatile, fun liked the design. We are not disappointed in any way and are happy with our purchase..  I replaced a BMW X3 with this car. As I wanted a little more room, I compared it to the 2006 BMW X5. The ORE is a better value.  Hesitant about the V-8, but average mileage is 20.0 mpg in mixed driving.  My 2.5L X3 averaged 22 mpg.  I gave up 2 mpg for an extra 125 h.p., a smoother ride and more room -an excellent trade off.  Excellent storage and cargo space. Very quiet ride. .  I purchased the Volvo XC90 V8 due to the safety and convenience features.  I have nothing but problems with the SUV.  It stalls and is a hazard.  Upon checking the internet, there are many purchasers that have had problems with the Volvo XC90.  Next time I will stick to Toyota/Lexus.  This Volvo is a headache.  By the way, this is supposed to be my wife\\'s SUV.  She is 7 months pregnant.  She will not be driving this vehicle!  Another issue is the towing capacity.  It is rated at 5000 pounds.  This is with the driver only.  Any passengers and cargo decreases this capacity rapidly.  Also, it requires a transmission cooler and brake controller.  The dealers won\\'t install them..  Great SUV. Enjoy driving and great for long trips. We test drove the BMW X5 but decided the Volvo XC90 was a great SUV for about $10,000 less. More cargo room, very safe, but needs a little bit more horespower but helps in gas savings (takes regular gas) compared to the X5..  How often can one say that spending over $40k for an automobile was a good feeling and/or investment - although the safety of my three under 4 years old is worth $40k - not often.  The XC90 is one of these autos. This is my 3rd Volvo, and it is an incredible machine. The XC90 can best be defined in two ways: powerful yet understated or aggressive yet humble...BUY THIS CAR MOM AND DAD!.  This XC90 is my 2nd Volvo. I love stylish interior design, smartly engineered 3rd row seat besides excellent safety features. It\\'s fun to drive in a highway from San Diego to San Francisco..  My husband surprised me with this car for Christmas.  I love it and I love all the safety features for it.  However, when I hit 10,000 miles my tires started making noises and after 3 trips to the dealer, they told me it was the Pirelli tires and they have had problems with them.  I would recommend the car but not the tires.  Also, if you have two carseats in the car then it is impossible for an adult to get to the third row without climbing over seats.  I agree that the inside door handles should not be plastic..  I was close to buying a VW Touareg before I test drove the Volvo.  I found the volvo to have excellent power in the 2.5T, better mileage, and more space.  I prefer the boxier look over the bubble look that is currently so popular. Only have a few 100 miles, but am really impressed with handling, especially on Hwy.  Mileage is mostly city, so in the lower mid teens, but on hwy it was very close to advertised, 22-23mpg. It does not have any cheesy extras you really don\\'t need, very practical. A bit sluggish at parking lot speed but if you punch it front tires will screach out without hesitation. I\\'ll follow up in a few months but for now I\\'m very pleased overall with this purchase..  Last vehicle was a 2004 Acura MDX. The XC90 has a better, with the V8, engine and transmission. Very comfortable with most of the controls in a good position. Only have 700 miles but have been averaging 19 mpg. Only driven it in the rain but the handling, while not sporty, is good. If you want a good overall SUV, this should be high on your list. Any BMW X5 will offer better handling and performance but doesn\\'t have the cargo space..  I love the comfort and the road handling. The third row seating for the kids is great. .  Traded an S40 for the XC90.  Ride is superb for an SUV.  Although under powered, the 2.5 Turbo does the job well. Lots of standard features plus received free incentives. Highway ride is wonderful. Was able to transition easily from the S40 to the larger XC90.  Intimidating at first, but after the first trip, it\\'s still a Volvo! .  This is our 6th Volvo, but not necessarily our favorite.  While the XC90 provides seating options that our V70 wagons and S70 and S80 sedans could not provide, the 2.5T engine is clearly underpowered for the weight of this vehicle.  Gas mileage is POOR and would have been worse if we had chosen the V8.  We love the safety features of this vehicle.  It handles well and is roomy enough for our passengers--- mostly children..  solid, safe and with surprising performance. did 20.6 mpg on an interstate trip of 800 miles [doing a steady 80]..  I was skeptical about venturing back into an SUV, as my last SUV was a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee, which was a gas guzzler and fairly trucky ride. One test drive of the XC90 cured me of any concerns I had related to comfort. The XC90 handles almost identical to my S60, which was traded for the XC. Volvo did a great job of creating a functional, elegant SUV that does as good of a job hauling stuff as it does safely transporting our daughter. And all without sacrificing safety..  Very impressive for a SUV - sturdy, good power, nice drive.  Quality interior & overall design - unmatched safety..  Before going for the XC90 V8, I drove the Porsche Cayanne S, Lexus GX470, Lexus LX470 and Acura MDX, Whiule the other SUV\\'s had a lot more bells and whistles (voice activated Navigation/Bluetooth, etc.), this SUV had the best performance, look, feel and room of the bunch, for the price. I love the power, the cabin is very nicely appointed. Everything is logically laid out and performs perfectly. I added the Bluetooth system, which works great with our phones. This is my third SUV and I am completely sold on Volvos after driving this one..  After having a new baby, my wife and I went looking for a better SUV with 3rd row seating. We had looked at Land Rover LR3 and Lexus GX470 but we settled with the Volvo XC90. Besides the excellent safety features of XC90 that my wife had strongly leaned-on, it had better gas mileage 17 city-23 hiway, smartly engineered 3rd row seating setup/folddown, middle seat booster conversion feature, premium sound, wider screen DVD (8.5in), ULEV-2 engine, and a luxurious ride. This is an all-weather and light off-roading vehicle with luxury that is more fitting to a family. The way this SUV is built - it\\'s a best buy for a reasonable price. But then there really is no price for safety for your family..  I have had the XC90 for 6 months now and it is very comfortable and easy to drive. Gas is not as bad as I thought...love it.  Very happy with our purchase, it really fits our life syle..bigger than bmw and lexus rx  .  This SUV rides like a sedan.  The Yamaha V8 gives it plenty of power. I can\\'t say enough good things about it.  The roomy interior has a clean, elegant look to it and the stereo is excellent and powerful.  Considering the projected resale value (best in class) You should not hesitate to buy one. .  After much dreaming and waiting for a VOLVO SUV, the XC90 does not disappoint. It\\'s a comfortable, safe people mover that gives everybody a great ride (3rd row seats are higher for better views). The V8/6-speeds are mated nicely (purrs well!). Good snow traction and power here in the Rockies and for the highways on OE all-season tires (special winter tires were not needed). Love the split rear hatch and easy access throughout. Beautiful looking vehicle, great lines and finish. A solid and well built machine. Well designed and thoughtful interior. Easy to read dials and settings (although the radio is a bit clunky to set). We\\'re going to get the Bluetooth installed next month. Great SUV. .  This is the best SUV that I\\'ve owned.  Previously I drove a 2000 Mercedes ML320, and the Volvo rides much better, more like a car than an SUV.  It has a good solid feel to it.  I\\'m 6\\'4\" tall, and I find the seats very comfortable.  The rear seat leg room is good, and the third row seats can actually be used by an adult.  Power from 2.5L engine is adequate, but it doesn\\'t have as much \\'pep\\' as my Mercedes, which I miss.  If you want more power get the V8 version.  I\\'ve been getting about 20 mpg on the highway.  The winter driving mode with the AWD is a nice feature.  I drove home in a substantial snow storm with no problems.  I looked at a lot of vehicles, and this is the best!.  In the past 10 years I owned 4 SUV\\'s including this. I had LexusRx330,Acura MDX and Mitsubishi Montero Sport. I feel VOLVO XC90 is a great SUV. VOLVO has great product than Lexus. I love the DVD, Booster seat,Premium Sound system and excellent interior. Mine is 7 seater SUV. I am getting  on average 16.4MPG in the city and 24.6MPG in the highy way. Very stylish and fun to drive. I feel like driving a Sedan. EXCELLENT SUV, go for it..  I can\\'t say enough about this car. It is easy and fun to drive, is very safe, and feels like a sturdy well built car. I chose this car after driving several others in the same price range. This by far seemed like you were getting more \"bang for your buck\".  I have this car fully loaded.  The navigation is great.  It prompts you, big screen, and is accurate.  I also love the DVD system.  The twin screens are great.  The car drives smoothly, and I have no problems (knock on wood).  I had previously owned the merceds that had issues every few months.  This is an excellent value for the price and you can put the cheap gas in.  The Booster Seat is also a great feature..  Our family\\'s first Volvo.  Bought it for my wife after she had a baby -- she\\'s no longer able to drive her 2-seater convertible with the baby.  We both love it.  Smooth drive.  Very stylish.  Chose this SUV after test driving and strongly considering BMW X5, VW Touareg, and Range Rover.  Choosing the Volvo just seemed clear to us to be the smart choice, especially when it comes to safety and reliability.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":65}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","retrieved_reviews_df_no_engine =

Safest car I've ever own..  Over 1/2 the cars we've owned have been Volvo...This one will change that. This has had constant noise in the form of clunks, squeals and rattles. There is always an error light or message on and we've spent a small fortune on parts. I'm a certified ASE mechanic and do all my own work but this has been a challenge. New rack and pinion, new exhaust, new struts, new springs, new tie rod ends, new radiator, new pulleys and new tires every 15K. This thing cant keep tires or brakes! The gas mileage is great, the power wonderful but everything else failed. The stereo is substandard and no one will touch it for aftermarket because of Volvos proprietary computers. The mirror trim has fallen off, the light dimmer/turn signal indicator fell off, windows get stuck. In short, this has left my wife stranded more then any vehicle she's owned. Tried to talk with dealership about issues but they create even more...worst dealer we've ever worked with. Tried to talk with Volvo and they didn't care. You can get a lemon but when the dealer and the manufacture wont help and in fact, exasperate the situation, it tells you it's time to move on. We're shopping for two new vehicles and wouldn't consider owning another Volvo. We actually bought a 2012 BMW X3. It's the best vehicle I've ever owned. Customer support is off the charts compared to Volvo and the vehicle arnt even in the same league! I'm angry at myself for waiting so long to get rid of Volvo...you really can enjoy your SUV.  My XC-90 is horrible, front to back.Friends don\\u0092t let friends buy volvo\\u0092s. Treatment from the volvo dealerships in Houston is horrible, unless you are super rich, they will certainly hook you up, otherwise, bring your checkbook.You pay out the nose to own a volvo. My xc-90? 3 sets of wheel bearings burned out, the rear end went out, the fuel pump has already been replaced, the CURRENT check engine light issue will cost me $1,000, just put $1,500 into it to get the steering column to work again, the Houston dealership seriously jacked me over. you HAVE to take it to the dealership. They know they've got you by the throat. OBTW, my windshield leaks. Headlights fogged from inside. $500 each.  Purchased a used 2006 Volvo XC90 AWD V8 a year ago, had 77K miles on it, but was in excellent condition and we thought very safe for our family.We didn't know it had a transmission that COULD NOT be repaired ONLY REPLACED.The Volvo dealership informed us that this particular transmission was not repairable.Unfortunately our warranty company wouldn't ok the replacement so we had to transfer the car to a transmission repair facility to try and rebuild it.They were able to get all the parts needed but 1 and Volvo wouldn't sell the 1 part that would fix our car.SO we had to purchase a USED transmission for $5,700.00 (new would have been $7,500)..  We purchased my Volvo used in 2007 and it had 36,000 miles on it.  We had recently had our second child and loved the safety features and quality of this car.  (Not to mention it is beautiful) It came with a few flaws, poor fuel consumption and rear doors that don't open wide enough in the back to get kids/groceries misc in and out.  Third row is a joke really, no room for normal sized adults.  Ok for children but hard to get them in and out.  Overall this vehicle made me happy for 3 years and we never had any repairs other than scheduled maintenance.  Just traded it in on a minivan due to our THIRD child arriving, but still missing my Volvo.  I'll have another one again someday..  110k mi & still drives fantastic! Smooth, powerful, tight handling & fun to drive. Happy with whole drivetrain.  Only problem so far was the \\\"infotainment software bug,\\\" which was fixed with quick update @ dealer.  DON'T get turbo model with \\\"garbage\\\" GM transmission. The V8's avg 1mpg gas penalty is worth every drop!  '05+ Yamaha V8 model has better Aisan Warner 6-speed & nice AWD system.  Did i mention the significant testicular fortitude?.  I bought this car used in Nov of 2008 and have had it for almost a year and a half.  I have not had one problem with this car.  I am very pleased with the performance.  The gas mileage could be better but i knew that going in.  The interior does not have enough space for all my stuff but I manage.  I really love driving this car and feel very safe in it. .  We've had the XC90 since Dec. 05 and have only performed scheduled maintenance. Comfort, safety, and reliability have been excellent. .  Got this car for thousands off because I bought it in 2007 when it was a 2006 model, but it was new. Very happy with the looks outside and inside. After a 5 months I had some problems, some anti-skid message that kept coming up, they said it was a computer problem but it happened twice. Possibly due to extremely horrible speed bumps where I live the car began making weird clicks when the gas/brakes were pressed; brake pads, alignment, sub-frame, etc all needed work. Right window makes whistling noise. DVD system headphones sound fuzzy sometimes. Very fast for an SUV, and I always feel safe..  I've had my '06 for 16 months now but before that had an 05.  Just test drove an ML 350 from Mercedes and I must say I prefer my Volvo. Granted the ML had a few features that were nice but overall, my Volvo had much more comfortable seats and more features for the price, i.e. dvd system, memory driver's seat, etc. I also have much more cargo area in my Volvo and because it's a bigger car I have more legroom and just feel safer. Close the doors on the Mercedes and do the same with the Volvo and you'll know the difference. My only gripe so far with the Volvo is the cheaply made stereo speaker units in the front corners. Should be better for a 50K+ vehicle..  An excellent car, firm ride.  You have the feeling of being in a safe car.  Goes through snow with ease. Very good handling.  I recommend this car to anyone who wants a safe car.  Gas mileage is a bit off and the gas tank is relatively small for a car of this size..  I love the ride but it has died in the middle of a busy intersection twice. It had to be towed back to the dealership and they replaced the fuel pump and we are waiting to see what they think it is this time. The driver's side beam has had to be replaced twice. The DVD system works intermittently. I thought Volvos were supposed to be dependable and safe. I have a 3 year old and I am going to have to get something else unfortunately..  Purchased a 2003 XC90 T6 new. Traded it in for a XC90 V8 in 2006. Totally different vehicle. Engine powerful and quiet.  No comparison with the T6.  T6 noisy, rough running and a gas hog.  V8 smooth as silk and much better MPG. Also, the T6 was a five passenger, the V8 a 7.  The V8 rides much smoother because of the self leveling rear. All in all a world class vehicle with a top IIHS safety rating. You can spend a lot more money on an SUV and I don't think you can buy a much better vehicle.  Dollar for dollar an excellent investment.  .  I have had my XC90 for just over a year now.  It's the best vehicle I've ever owned but has some small drawbacks that I can overlook. The driver seat is already starting to feel as if it is wearing on the outer bolster.  Overall it handles great for its size and does better than great on the autobahn in Germany at speed.  The 6-speed tip-tronic changes are somewhat slushy during gear changes.  I still compare it to the Touareg and LR3 that my co-workers have and I find it to be a better vehicle than theirs.  Some of the options could come down in price.  Over $3k for navigation is too much.  I bought an aftermarket system for less than $600.  But you pay quality money for a quality SUV..  From the delivery from Neftin Volvo ( awesome dealership) the XC90 has been my favorite car ever.  Rides like a magic carpet and off roads like rhino.  I LOVE IT!.  I waited 2 yrs for this car!  Needed the suv body style,  very happy with this!  A few minor problems (computer errors).  At 25,000 miles, had to replace tires.  Not happy about that. Was told its common on Awd suvs?!  Would like to know what other owners think about this.  .  I replaced a BMW X3 with this car. As I wanted a little more room, I compared it to the 2006 BMW X5. The ORE is a better value.  Hesitant about the V-8, but average mileage is 20.0 mpg in mixed driving.  My 2.5L X3 averaged 22 mpg.  I gave up 2 mpg for an extra 125 h.p., a smoother ride and more room -an excellent trade off.  Excellent storage and cargo space. Very quiet ride. .  I purchased the Volvo XC90 V8 due to the safety and convenience features.  I have nothing but problems with the SUV.  It stalls and is a hazard.  Upon checking the internet, there are many purchasers that have had problems with the Volvo XC90.  Next time I will stick to Toyota/Lexus.  This Volvo is a headache.  By the way, this is supposed to be my wife's SUV.  She is 7 months pregnant.  She will not be driving this vehicle!  Another issue is the towing capacity.  It is rated at 5000 pounds.  This is with the driver only.  Any passengers and cargo decreases this capacity rapidly.  Also, it requires a transmission cooler and brake controller.  The dealers won't install them..  Last vehicle was a 2004 Acura MDX. The XC90 has a better, with the V8, engine and transmission. Very comfortable with most of the controls in a good position. Only have 700 miles but have been averaging 19 mpg. Only driven it in the rain but the handling, while not sporty, is good. If you want a good overall SUV, this should be high on your list. Any BMW X5 will offer better handling and performance but doesn't have the cargo space..  solid, safe and with surprising performance. did 20.6 mpg on an interstate trip of 800 miles [doing a steady 80]..  Very impressive for a SUV - sturdy, good power, nice drive.  Quality interior & overall design - unmatched safety..  Before going for the XC90 V8, I drove the Porsche Cayanne S, Lexus GX470, Lexus LX470 and Acura MDX, Whiule the other SUV's had a lot more bells and whistles (voice activated Navigation/Bluetooth, etc.), this SUV had the best performance, look, feel and room of the bunch, for the price. I love the power, the cabin is very nicely appointed. Everything is logically laid out and performs perfectly. I added the Bluetooth system, which works great with our phones. This is my third SUV and I am completely sold on Volvos after driving this one..  This SUV rides like a sedan.  The Yamaha V8 gives it plenty of power. I can't say enough good things about it.  The roomy interior has a clean, elegant look to it and the stereo is excellent and powerful.  Considering the projected resale value (best in class) You should not hesitate to buy one. .  After much dreaming and waiting for a VOLVO SUV, the XC90 does not disappoint. It's a comfortable, safe people mover that gives everybody a great ride (3rd row seats are higher for better views). The V8/6-speeds are mated nicely (purrs well!). Good snow traction and power here in the Rockies and for the highways on OE all-season tires (special winter tires were not needed). Love the split rear hatch and easy access throughout. Beautiful looking vehicle, great lines and finish. A solid and well built machine. Well designed and thoughtful interior. Easy to read dials and settings (although the radio is a bit clunky to set). We're going to get the Bluetooth installed next month. Great SUV. \",\n          \" Solid vehicle, no major repairs in 7 years of ownership, mileage isn\\u2019t a plus, but excellent overall value otherwise..  The car is great and is very roomy for a sedan. It doesn't get great gas mileage when traveling in the city, but it is comfortable. I wish the A/C vents had a switch to turn them off. A big complaint is that in order to replace the headlights, you need to take it to a dealership or car repair shop, because the whole front bumper needs to be taken off to access the headlights. Other than the dumb design of that, I really love the car!.  Be sure to look around any buy the one you want, some Malibus from this generation have different features than others like remote start, sun roof, color options, etc. Be sure to shop around and buy what you want! This car is awesome on long highway trips! Very comfortable and great gas mileage!.  Great car to save money on gas and use for long trips..  Unless you enjoy dropping hundreds-thousands of dollars on repairs every couple of months do not buy this car! As soon as it\\u2019s warranty expires it starts falling apart. Not to mention it\\u2019s nearly impossible to work on it yourself as GM specially designed it to require special tools and equipment to fix. Even simple problems like a broken speaker turn costly fast. I\\u2019ve already replaced the transmission, had to replace all 4 brakes multiple times, had the body control module \\u201crepaired\\u201d under a recall (which started going bad again a couple years later and no, they won\\u2019t fix it again), the cruise control won\\u2019t always disengage when you press the brakes (scarey!!!), the brake lights only work sometimes, the speakers only work sometimes, and the list only goes on from there. At this point I am trying to wash my hands of this piece of garbage by selling it and getting a little bit of money back, it\\u2019s only been able to go about 1-3 weeks at a before something else brakes so I have to keep sticking money into it so I can even sell it. I am also learning the hard way how fast these cars depreciate. My car is only 6 years old and sold for around $25,000 new and is now worth about $7,000, a little over half of what I paid a few years ago. That\\u2019s with only 94,000 miles and no rust, dents, or scratches. I wouldn\\u2019t tak another Chevy or even GM vehicle of someone paid me..  Wonky transmission, poor paint quality, and overall drabness drove me to switch to an Asian-made vehicle for the first time in my life..  Don't buy this car. I got this for a good deal in 2013, at the time the car was 2 years old and had less then 40k miles on it. Should have got the extended warranty because the transmission gave out entirely last year after just 95k miles (!!). It cost $3500 to replace, which is likely more than the car was worth. Lots of little problems every service, easily costing me thousands over the last four years. This despite me taking it to the dealer for service every six months and following all recommended procedures. The mileage is quite poor, and the car is does not accelerate as quickly as one would hope. Also, if the headlamps go out, you have to remove the front bumper just to change it (pathetic design - really hope that GM engineer was fired). So what should be a $20 fix is instead $150 with the labor charges. The only upside to this car is the storage room and legroom, which are both quite good. But otherwise it is no-frills, and pretty poor build quality. I would not recommend this car to anyone..  This was the least comfortable car I have ever owned. The seats were hard and the seams cut into the lower back and tail bone. The interior cabin was noisy and we could hear all the road noise and feel every road bump.  We traded it in after about 7 months and LOST over 12,000 in resale value!  I would not recommend this car to my worst enemy!.  If you by used dealers charge way more than its worth. Motor troubles at 70000 even if you maintain. Buy it out right do not finance otherwise make sure you have at leat 5000 stocked away for car emergencies. Make sure you get a good warranty dont go with C.A.R.S PLUS PROTECTION they dont cover much. This car will give you financial blues . Brake sysytem too sensors are no if good. If you have children steer clear!!!!!.  Two days after buying it I had to put it in the shop a bunch of recalls feel unsafe to drive and transport my kids in.  For the few years between carting kids to practice then college in a mini-van I had a sports car.  THEN my kids had kids :-) and I needed a car that could hold up to three car seats / booster seats depending on grandkids in the back seat.  There is room and the back seat is a \\\"flat\\\" bench with pre-installed hooks for carseats.  Hook to the frame on both sides of the bottom, hook to the frame behind headrest and seats were appropriately installed and *I* did it!  Easy in and out as I also transport my elderly parents in the car.  Both front and back doors open wide (be sure passengers know that lest the next car get dinged) and I can have Mom put both legs out and on the ground, she holds the bracket and my hand and up we go.  I regret that I don't have leather seats, which I've always had.  However, the upholstery is of good quality and cleans with a babywipe.  I'm picky about dust, etc, and it looks great just driving through a carwash.  The computer in the car is so accurate I know when tire pressure needs attention, mpg readout is accurate, oil life.  Poor quality inside and out, with a lot of plastic.  However, it's a comfortable and quiet car that's easy to drive in any weather..  .  This car is AWESOME. FUN TO DRIVE SUPER SAFE AND RELIABLE I HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT!!.  What a mistake this piece of junk is. There are countless recalls and they are all on insignificant things. Do yourself a favor and google \\\"2011 Chevy Malibu Engine Power Decreased\\\" and read the reviews about this POS. There is no recall for a problem that costs not only $2,000 TO FIX, but can be deadly. Long story short, there is a faulty sensor that goes out somewhere between 50,000-120,000 miles (roll of the dice) that is going to without warning make your car shake and reduce your engine power. There are stories about people on the freeway that had this happen while driving and their car dropped to 25 miles per hour.Go in to get it fixed, $2,000 to replace the damage this stupid sensor has caused. Don't buy this car. Ever. For any reason. Until there is a full recall don't touch it..  I can't say enough good things about this car!  It runs super quiet, has great pick up and passing power, rides smooth, gets great gas mileage (27/mpg combined for me with 50/50 city/highway), looks sharp and has awesome audio system. I'm thinking of buying another one right one for one of my teenagers. It's been a while since we've owned a domestic car but the 2011 Malibu has changed our minds - we're a Chevy family now!!.  I have bought GM products starting with a 1967 Camaro through even a Chevy Vega and continuing to the present up to and including the aforementioned 2011 Malibu.  My guess is that I have purchased over the years about 20 GM products, so this comment does not come from a closet Ford or Dodge owner.  At 120,000 miles the transmission just quit.  Everyone I know who owns something other than a GM product have in excess of  that with no problem.  I try to be loyal to not only the brand but the dealership.  Basically, I was told by the dealer here in Idaho that your car is worth nothing and a transmission will cost you $3,500.  So the car is at the dealership and I have had to borrow cars to get around.  Your alternatives are few short of putting a for sale sign on the car and parking it at the dealership.  There was no effort to try to ameliorate the frustration by either the company or the dealership.  I will put in  the transmission, but I will not return to Chevrolet or the dealership.  The lesson to be learned  from this to always get the cheapest price as there is no advantage to being loyal to a brand or a dealer.  The travails continued after I picked up the car,with new transmission, it sounded awful when it started lots of valve clatter and before I got out of the parking lot the check engine light came on.  On Star diagnostics said it needed to go back to the dealer.  After having it for at least two weeks and paying them $3,500 the car was not running.  The service manager was busy explaining it was not his fault and I was busy thinking that is a load of crap.  To say I was angry and disappointed would be an under statement.  He said it would take 40 minutes to change the now defective sensor; he was back in less than 5.  Clearly they failed to make all the proper connections and it was just a question of correcting that.  About the only concession was that I was not charged.    The silver lining was Chevy.  They stepped up and offered a discount on any GM product, after they failed to get anything from the dealer.  I currently have a 2016 Malibu-from a different dealer-and I have been pleased with it.  All of this could have been avoided had the dealer shown any concern.  I have no intention of returning to the dealer and have heard nothing from them since I sold the car.  The new Malibu does not shift nearly as often as the old and gets better gas mileage.  With almost 40,000 miles on the new vehicle there have been no problems and with my driving pattern it returns over 35 mpg combined.  I am completely satisfied at this juncture.  We are looking at purchasing another vehicle.  It very well might be another Chevy, but not from that dealer.  Any concession would have kept me as a customer, but their shortsightedness might have provided a short term gain, but at a long term loss..  I had my Malibu 2LT w/ a V6 engine for 9 months.  I had it in the shop FIVE times in that period.  Once for a piston replacement, once for replacing spark plugs/cylinder coils, once for replacing wiring to cylinders, once for replacing water hose... the list of problems with this car are incredible!  On one hand, the V6 has a nice smooth get-up-and-go feel to it.  The engine sounds great but never forces the car to lose its composure on the road.  The look of the Malibu is sharp - nothing over the top, but enough smooth but pronounced edges to make you have a quick glance.  I couldn't believe this was a Chevy at first.  But then I spent a lot of time in the car and realized that the seats aren't comfortable (they squeeze and push my arms forward a bit), lumbar support sucks (optional lumbar control is mostly for show and ends up being very bad for your back according to my friend who's a practicing chiropractic).  The door materials are cheap and plastic-y, there's a lot of stuff you can tell will break easily.  The glove box had numerous scratches from a small handful of passengers getting in/out of the vehicle.  Chevy basically did a nice job updating the Malibu but failed to give it real quality interior.  The 4-cyl engine MAY be decent - fewer moving parts = fewer things to go wrong.  But I ended up with TWO V-6 engines because Jiffy Lube left my oil filter off and my engine seized a couple days later.  They paid for the replacement engine, but funny-enough the second V6 has a couple of the same issues within weeks of it being installed!  Fortunately they repairs were covered, but I lost two weeks of work over 2 months because of my car problems.  Do not buy the V6 engine, as having 2 bad engines (one of which was \\\"re-certified\\\") means this is not a good car to buy to last you several years.  Look toward 2013 and newer where the Malibu is getting much better initial quality scores and offers much better interior options..  I bought my 2011 Malibu LT2 back at the beginning of 2015 and have been using it for nearly 8 months.  I opted for a V6 because it was such an excellent price that I figured \\\"why not?\\\".  That engine has some pull to it (roughly 250hp) and sounds pretty smooth.  The only problem is the advertised fuel efficiency numbers aren't quite right.  In the city of Seattle, I get around 15-17mpg and on the freeway, if I am on cruise control between 60-65, I get sneak up to 29-31mpg (with a level road surface).  Any incline will drop the hwy mileage to around 24-25mpg.  Stop and starts with the V6 are what really murder your fuel efficiency here.  The seats are almost fine, but my back will hurt after long drives because the seats force your shoulders in a bit and my upper back is forced back - almost like a mild squeeze.  Smaller bodies probably won't notice this as much (I'm 6'2 and have a wider build that the average person), but it's an annoyance.  The quality of the Malibu LT2 is inconsistent.  I have some kind of leather/suede-fabric hybrid that makes cleaning a bit tougher than it should be.  The dashboard and door panels are composed of a cheap plastic material that scratches easily.  The instrumentation and radio/temp controls are fine.  Nothing fancy but nothing to complain about.  The 6-speaker system is adequate for most people.  You can get reasonable volumes without distortion in the audio but the system is built to cap everything off in that department before you hit those higher volumes that would degrade your listening experience.  I've heard a 2013 Malibu's 2LT/LTZ stereo which uses a Bose system (I think) and it's a step up (though still doesn't quite compete with some higher-grade car stereos out there).  As for reliability: I've had my car in a couple times this year - once for a piston replacement (fortunately under warranty, but just barely) and the other for simple coil and spark plug replacements, which are actually easy to replace, I just hadn't learned how to do it yet (a YouTube video can literally save you $500 in parts and labor for replacing one or multiple coils that sit atop your engine).  All in all the Malibu for this year is decent.  It has a solid look to it and offers decent options, depending on what trim you end up with.  The LT2 or LTZ vehicles are the best available so if you do buy one, try and look for those trims.  But from what I've been hearing about the newer Malibus - you're better off buying used 2014 and beyond because the 4cyl is closer to the Nissan Altima fuel efficiency ratings and the quality of the cabin materials has drastically improved.UPDATE: I got rid of my Malibu because the V6 engine kept having issues. I had a fuel pump issue, cylinder head issues, and more within 6 months. Had it in the shop 3 times. Jiffy Lube eventually destroyed the engine when they didn't put the oil filter all the way onto my engine after an oil change. The car was okay, if a bit cheap with cabin materials, but I've since driven a 2014 Malibu and they did a MUCH better job all around with that vehicle. Don't buy the 2008-2012 models if you can because your value is so much better in the newer ones (and the fuel efficiency is great)..  All around good car. I do about 80% highway driving and get an avg 31 mpg. People have to realize that this car is not a powerhouse; if you drive it like a high school-er you will be disappointed in your gas mileage. Treating your car nice goes a long way- tires-brakes-suspension-etc. Anyways, there's something about this car that makes me miss driving it when I'm in another vehicle. Especially my wife's dodge dart turbo..... Man that thing is a piece of crap..  I had 3 Malibu's 2006, totaled by a drunk driver.2006, totaled by a bus. Car accelerated into traffic. I reversed as my choice was a gasoline tanker and a bus.2011 : This car from day one has been a lemon.It is getting worse. I have 18 k on the car. I get 21 miles on open highway and 17 in city.I have been told by GM to put 20 more thousand miles to loosen it up. Door on drivers side leaks and has \\\"been\\\" fixed only to leak worse. At 40 mph there is a dinging in the right rear. At 60 mhp under load the steering column shakes and rattles the whole car. If you let off the gas it quits. Dealer told me this is \\\"normal\\\".Transmission fluid is dark brown...\\\"normal\\\" too.UPDATE: 3 recalls:Battery has been replace 3 times, due to a short in the \\\"electrical\\\" system. Antenna and grounding cable rotted off. Transmission kept surging. Taken to dealer via flatbed. After 38k miles. Dealer called and asked who put or changed trans fluid?When I asked why? It is I gallon over capacity. The stress from cavitation has taken its toll. The shifter is sloppy and can bee put into reverse.I met a service manager in the market. He told me that the car\\\" has a long list of electrical issues, which would cost several thousand to fix.\\\"His advice was to sell it.I asked \\\" to whom? \\\"JUNK,TRASH, Will never buy another GMC!.  Purchased a few months ago. Already put on 4,000 miles. It's a very comfortable car Me being 6'6\\\" I fit quite well. Although anyone who sits behind me had better be quite short! Monique as she is rightfully named is a snappy accelerator, corners fantastically, and I love the clad wheels. Trunk is huge. I had taken a trip to Frankfot KY. and I averaged 37.7mpg!! with a full trunk At times the remote start is finicky, but no complaints. She was a lease car before I bought her. The driver seat is kind of like crumpled near the door, which is causing a tear. Which is very disappointing. Considering my 02 Impala had over 230,000 on it and no rips or tears..  poor gas millage on a 4 cylinder 19-23mpg mostly hwy miles. traction and break control systems  failed causing accident. this is an unsafe car. car under warranty 34000 miles. GM response less than helpful. GM black box was tested for and showed no  accident infomation but driver side airbags failure in reality drivers door crushed in. Car under warranty was taken by me and GM to several dealerships, SUNSHINE CHEVROLET tech told me by the codes the two parts that would have causes the issues. GM made by back and now SUNSHINE CHEVROLET won't service  the new chevrolet..  I have owned 3 prior new GM vehicles.This one has been trouble from day 1.First it had rail dust, orange rust spots all over the car in which it took the dealer three times to fix. Then the wheels vibrated, which they never could fix. After spending at least 12 different trips to the dealer, I now have two bent rims.This car gets driven MAYBE twice a week by my wife. I will be trading this car in, and I am very disappointed with this car. Very cramped on the inside, trunk is very short, plastic trim comes off all the time.Exterior badging fell off.Horrible wheels.Horrible (20mpg) gas mileage.I will never buy a GM car again.So many recalls..  Have less than 29,000 miles on the car, the front ROTORS have been resurfaced once and replaced twice !Front BRAKES replaced once.The back ROTORS have been replaced once, and BRAKES replaced once.I have filed a complaint with GM.The mileage is not close to where they advertised !In addition the transmission doesn't act right.I have been told there is no problem with it !I would love to hear from others that have had brake and rotor issues, or anyone that has been successful at GM buying the while back ? !Please.....  Have owned this car for 20 months and wanted to wait until this point to write a review on this Malibu.This has been the most reliable car I have ever owned(and I have owned over a dozen new cars in 33years of driving). It has never been to the shop for any unscheduled service.I was not planning to trade when I did, but an unexpected windfall convinced me to trade and was glad I did!This car now has almost 25,000miles and still is as tight and quiet as the day I drove it from the dealership.Every thing works the way it is supposed to.I am averaging 26mpg in 70%/30%hwy-city driving which is NOT what I was hoping for when I bought this car, but it's not terrible..  I rented a 2011 Sonata for 3 months and was pleased to get 23.5 mpg combined. I drive about 100 miles a day and the ratio of city/highway is 50/50. We looked at buying the 2011 Sonata, Camry or Malibu because they claim to get the same mileage. We ended up with an LTZ and I am lucky to get 19 mpg combined. Pure highway driving only gets me 21 mpg. Not happy with American cars right now and it is always the drivers fault with mileage even though the cars are all driven the same way..  I like the car but, ever since it was new it has a shake at low speed when I accelerate from a stop. It only happens when a person is in the passenger front seat. I took it into the dealer for the second time for this issue and they recommended that they rotate and balance the tires at a cost to $60.00 to me. He told me that would take care of the problem, but it has'nt. If anyone has any solutions for this problem it would be greatly appreciated..  I got this car new I only have 12000 miles on it and i have complained from the first 500 miles that the car has a shake between 15 and 20 miles per hour. This has been addressed to the maintenance people at Ray Dennison with no satisfaction This is not normal per the maintenance people.I am now experiencing other things like a rumble when I accelerate.This car has been very disappointing I will never buy another probably never another chevy poor gas mileage.  Love. This. Car. We had an '05 and traded up this year (2012) for a '11. We got the baseline model for a really good price and then added a few features at Bestbuy for much cheaper than the dealer could do. I haven't had any problems with the gas mileage (getting about 28 combined). The only aspect that I'm not a fan of is the top of the dashboard. When the sun is directly overhead or in front of you, the reflection of the dashboard shines back into the windshield. It's can be distracting. Should have test driven during the evening... I've gotten used to it, but it can be a problem when you first get the car. The trunk is very deep, another plus..  I bought a 2011 lt malibu,last september,from the min.I drove it home on take off ,steering wheel you could feel a shaking ,wobble.,GM said they know about the problem but donn;t know how to fix it yet....nice you buy a carand feel this every day ,so after 6 months i take a big lose and buy a used impala...chey wins i loose...gm said they will not help me,,i also get at best 23----to -28,5 mpg...my sons impala gets 30 most of the time...junk...car and company...trunk is so tight a food cooler cann;t fit.  Bought a 2011 Malibu for the daughter.Great value with all of the rebates.Great gas milage, dependable, comfortable car for the money.Would definetley recommend..  I love this car - looks, ride, quiet, comfort and I have had absolutely no problems.I currently have 14,000 miles on it and I have had it a year.My major disappointment comes when it comes to milage my overall average mpg on this car since new is 22 mpg overall (yes I have tracked every tank). I never speed and drive very casual and this is the first car EVER that I could not achieve the advertised mpg on.I got rid of a car that would do 27 mpg all day long on the highway and 23-24 city.This car gets under 20 in town and 27-28 hwy.I ask EVERYONE I see and they all say the same thing - anyone on here that says it will do any better does not know how to track milage. 4cyl.  We have had our Malibu for a year now.The car runs well and gets very good gas mileage out on the open road.Some real problems as we see it.The temp guage that reads the outdoor temp., it is designed not to work.It will work when you get in and go to town but then it will read that same temp until you have gone over 35mph for 5 miles or 15 minuets or something like that or if your car sits for more than 3 hours.If you stay in town the whole day it will stay on the original temp of the morning even if it goes up 40 degrees.Why I ask but GM said it was designed that way.Then there is the issue of not being able to chain the car up.Also the rear head rests obstruck your view..  OK this is my second review of this car after having it for 7 months and putting almost 18000 miles on it.as stated before i owned an 09 LS and upgraded to an 11 LTZ.I liked the car enough to buy another one so that should say something.I still stand by the majority of my first review and I still love this car, but there is one major difference.GAS MILEAGE!!!The 09 had a 4 speed auto, this one has a 6 speed auto.So I should do better on gas mileage right? wrong.I drive mostly highway and got about 75 miles more on a full tank in the 09.still not bad, but chevy is flat out lying about getting 33 miles mpg.im getting 23 with 80% highway usage.otherwise great car..  This car is a pain in the A - - -. I have already voiced my dis like of the seats. And mentioned the annoying \\\"low pressure\\\" warning about the tires. After receiving and E mail advising the tire pressures are low, I check with my tire gauge and sure enough one tire has 15 lbs, another has 20 lbs., another has 12 lbs and the last has 25 lbs. WHY, WHY, WHY, WHY. !!!!!!! I have never had this problem with any car I have owned. Question:Are the tires crap?Are the wheels at fault, what is going on ?And the fuel mileage is still only 23 to 24 mpg, NOT 30 !!!!! My Nissan gets 32 mpg around town. What a piece of junk. GM should be ashamed.I have contacted GM customer service and they just .  I've had my malibu for almost a month now and it's the best car I have ever owned! I read all these reviews before I purchased and they are spot on.The thing performs like a 6 cyl and gets better gas mileage than the crummy aveo I traded in.Styling is terrific! When I pulled up to my girls house she thought it was a BMW.Few things I would change. 1st is the headroom' it's not bad when sitting in the vehicle but I often hit my head while entering. 2nd is there are no handles inside for the passengers to hold.3rd, the heated seat switch is on the seat in an awkward place.Other than that it's perfect! Tight, quiet and fun to drive...big head turner too.$25,000 for luxury at it's best!.  Bought my Malibu in January of this year.There is nothing about it that I do not like.Base model, Summit White exterior.Fantastic gas mileage. I try to focus on my driving habits and make an effort to use cruise control when possible and as result I was able to achieve 39.4 miles per gallon on a recent round-trip to Columbus OH from Indianapolis.Goal was not to exceed 65 MPH.Weekly fill-ups (40% city, 60% highway) always average 27-28 MPG. The car looks sharp inside and out.Chevy created a real winner..  I just came off a lease of a '09 Merc Milan L4 My my new Malibu is so much better in every catagory.  I purchased a a Malibu in the fall and I am very disappointed in the gas mileage, I drive mainly on the highway and only receive around 24 to 25 miles per gallon.I purchase this vehicle for the good gas mileage and chevy isn't standing behind their advertisements of 23 city to 33 highway..  I bought an LS in 2009 and it was a great car.Took a few thousand miles to get the good gas milage but it was great to have even for a basic car.Well chevy was offering some great deals on the 2011s so I decided to upgrade to a fully loaded 2011 LTZ.I couldn't be happier.It's fun to drive even for a 4 banger and looks good on the road or sitting in the parking lot.The 09 had a 4 speed auto and this one has a 6 speed auto, so it does feel a little different on shifts and sometimes will lag between shifts but overall I just love this car.Recommend to anyone..  This car is a delight to drive.I have had a malibu before and went to a HHR [no where near as nice].I went back to a malibu this year .I could not pass up the deal i got with the rebate ,credit union discount and previous owner discount.It took a while [2,000 miles] to gain thegood gas mpg .On the highway in cruise i get 35mpg with the 4 banger.Has plenty of power and rides smooth.Looks rich with the mocha exterior and cocoa/cashmere interior.I am a happy puppy with it .i hope it continues with no problems .I again say its a delightfull dish [car].  A very comfortable car with good handling, decent power,and excellent economy.Have about 6000 miles on the odometer and have gotten up to 37 mpg (at 5 mph over freeway speeds) using a light throttle and cruise control.Very good in ice and snow here in the Northeast..  Great looking car ,love to drive everyday!! .  I just bought my first Malibu about a week ago and I am quite impressed at this vehicle. I really like the design of this car. I was never impressed with the older Malibu style but GM did a nice job on this body style. I must say that it has a \\\"big car\\\" ride and the 2.4 litre 4 cyl. engine puts out a fair amount power. I am over six feet tall and I have ample headroom..  very nice car, surprised at power and overall ride control,love the white diamond paint and the way it handles in ice and snow. Overall very nice car, and impressed wit it more everyday. .  So this is our second Chevrolet. Our first was the umpteenth generation of the Suburban (a 2007). It was an awesome vehicle. Amazingly reliable. So, after our lease was up we decided to try another. With a focus on fuel economy we decided to go with the Malibu. We love this car so far it is very nice and comfortable. Extremely Quiet and the ride is very strong. We love the power of the 4 cylinder and are very impressed with the styling. Love this CAR! GM, you have won us over. .  I purchased My Malibu to save money on fuel, and have a comfortable ride. My first stop for gas netted me over 32MPG. This car is very comfortable for me (6'3\\\" and over 280lbs), although the door opening could be a little larger.I am finding the 2.4 4cyl engine to be adequate, but if you want the good MPG, you need to drive it light there is an egg between your foot and the gas pedal..  After looking at all the competition, we bough a 2008 Malibu and put 50,000 miles on it. Last week the car was totaled in an accident.The safety systems performed well. We did another review of the 2011 competition, again the answer was Malibu. Hard to beat the features performance and price..  I shopped Nissan, Hyundai, Toyota, Ford Escape, an used Mercedes Benz. After driving the Mercedes (2004 model), my daughter tried Malibu. She can hardly hear the engine.  The car is smooth and GM dealership behaved as if they were a Lexus dealership. The deal of Malibu in Black Friday was amazing. It seems GM changed the money factors that day.  The car is beautiful looking, with power. It has some indescribable feeling of exhilaration while driving it. A state of bliss that no Malibu in the past offered. It awakens self-confidence in drivers who feel much richer and free. Its a car for the young, suddenly. It help you aim high and see possible what one thought impossible before..  I find this to be a very comfortable and quite car. It handles very well and I think it also looks very good. It also has very good mpg. I drive around 70 miles every day and this car makes the drive very pleasant. As a whole, I am very happy with this car and will certainly recommend it..  The car is new, so too soon to tell if it will stand up to the test of time. I like the look of the car. Seats not great, could be more comfortable. Love the on star feature. When I needed help with getting a spare the Chevy dealership, and the Chevy corporate headquarters was very unresponsive. I would hate to have to deal with them over a really serious issue, they just don't seem to care once your out the door and they have your money. .  I just brought my car. I am in love. I was going for an 08 2lt, however i left with an 2011 1LT with a sunroof in blue. .  Just purchased in October 2010. A very pleasant and quiet driving experience especially on smooth roads. Much less quiet on bumpy roads. The car handles beautifully. I am already getting 5 MPH better overall than with my 2003 Buick and i am looking forward for even better mileage as i break it in. Average now is 27 MPG. The bucket seats are not as soft as i am used to but i think i can get used to them. Bluetooth and on star are excellent features and i am already using them.\",\n          \" Be sure to check Warranty package.  This is a really great car for the price point. Remember that this is an entry level economy car. Keeping that criteria in mind and you will not find a better value considering the 10 year warranty. No other manufacturer is standing by that long to keep your car running tops. The one issue I have found is that the fuel mileage is not as good as it should be for a 1.6L 4cyl. Mine is the 6 speed automatic and I average 27-30 mpg with a mix of driving. If you drive really easy and with great care, you can get the average up to 30-33 mpg. That is a lot less than is shown on the sticker. I can still say that it is very nice car for running around town and will hold quite a bit of storage when the seats are folded down. No regrets on this little car so far. I have put about 22K miles on it..  The trunk space isn't the best, but besides that its been a great car..  The seatbelt has a bulge that rubs against your left leg causing leg injury ..  Yes it's green!  Great car!  Quiet.  Great pickup on sport mode.  Dealership worked to get me great deal..  My wife first had a 2010 Soul and traded it on a new new 2012 VW Beetle.  We traded that in a year later on a 2014 Soul ! for her and one for me.  We really liked those cars but are always looking at others.  Traded them in on 2 Chevy Trax, the top model.  Then about a year and half went back to to the Souls.  One for each  of us and we are not going to change.  Easy in and out, more elbow room than the Trax and more storage room.  Love and use the under floor storage in the back.  Don't feel cramped in the seats which are very comfortable.  Our trip via car to Las Vegas from Minnesota was very nice.  The 200 hp engine in the ! was not taxed by the Rockies. No extreme down-shifting when going up the mountains.  Carried all our luggage (and we have a lot because we are gone for 10 days and all our electronics,pills and food.  The touch screen radio and navigation and climate controls are easy to use (we are 68 and 70 years old.)  Gas mileage around town is consistently 24 to 25 MPG and highway runs 31 or so.  Most of the Souls we see on the road or in town are driven by older people who need easy in and out and all the other features..  I get decent mileage but the MPG estimate on the dash consistently over-estimates by 5-10% (versus actual miles driven at each fill-up). The Bluetooth button on the 2017 model is actually a Siri button, so if you don't have an iPhone, it does absolutely nothing. Hands-free on an Android is limited to only answering an incoming call or calling the last phone number in your history..  Car was a rental while on vacation and fell in love with it. Easy to get in and out of and handled like a dream. Gas mileage was good and car was very quiet. Glad I got a chance to drive it and would definitely consider buying..  Tired of having to squirm and twist to get in and out of your car?  Try that in a Soul.  Then take it for a drive.  Convinced me. Long warranty from factory helped, too..  I have a three year lease on a 2017 Soul. I have owned the vehicle for just a few weeks now. In that time I have made the following observations. It is important to keep in mind that this is a base vehicle. I see it filling a niche was owned by the VW Bug, with technology and comfort. My 1.6 130 hp with an automatic transmission is plenty of motor for this car. The mileage is amazing and I love all the technology that tells me about my consumption and range.  I find that I drive a bit slower in this vehicle for some reason. Getting in and out are important to me and this is done with ease. I wish the front seat had a few more adjustments but it is fairly comfortable. The Soul is easy to drive and the ergonomics are good. The technology is easy to understand and use for an older driver like me, love the Bluetooth.. This vehicle is easy to park and navigate well in tighter areas. The one real knock on the Soul is that its smaller windows create very dangerous blind spots. If you don't have a warning system and I don't, the passenger side has a huge driver's blind spot. The drivers side is also bad but not as bad. Overall I am delighted with my KIA Soul..  This car has most of the things I wanted in a vehicle all put into one.  I had been searching and test drove quite a few vehicles and walked away from each disappointed about something.  That was not the case with this one.  The ride is smooth and the EXCLAIM is very quick.  I used to drive a smaller hatchback and got tired of having essentially fall into my car.  With the soul, the seats are at waist height and I quite literally just walk into my seat.  Just yesterday, I took a friend out in it who owns a truck and he mentioned this very thing.  He was saying he has to climb up into his truck and loves that you can just walk into the seat.  I said the same thing regarding my golf (as you just read).  I also got the Tech Package and I am very pleased with the sound system.  It is superb.  Definitely not a miss there.  The audio controls actually make sense and is very easy to navigate.  I test drove some cars that were just way too complicated (looking at you Honda).  We don't want complicated while we're driving.  I want to push 2 buttons max to get where I want and do what I want.  The fuel economy is actually lower than advertised, and that's kind of a bummer.  I drive mostly (that's 90%) interstate and am lucky if I break 28 overall.  The A/C unit is not what I'd call amazing.  There are definitely better A/C units out there.  Other than that... very comfortable.  Drives great.  Turns on a dime (better than my Hatchback did, but the hatchback handled like a dream... cuz it's a hatchback).  I am not at all disappointed and would highly recommend it.  Also, Kia's warranty kind of tells a story of a company who's not afraid to offer a high warranty because they have faith in their product.  Seriously, their warranty is twice as good as anyone else's.  Highly recommended..  I now own two Kia Souls - The first one (2013) was so impressive in build quality I bought a second upon reading the 2017 reviews. When Car and Driver and Road and Track give a 4.5 out of 5 stars - one pays attention. The 2017 I own Is simply amazing in build quality, ride handling and amenities ...... No comparison out there especially considering price..  had a 2012 soul and traded in for a 2017 model.  Not many changes between the years, except 2017 does not come with a cd player standard.  Still no spare tire.  new car has the nitrogen filled tires.  I like the car for the handling, and overall comfort. but its overpriced..  I've always liked the Kia Souls but never got one because I felt they were under powered. Enter the 2017 Kia Soul ! and its 1.6L turbo engine. The engine isn't the problem with this car. The problem is that it is only available on the Exclaim model and the Exclaim has added and subtracted a few things. They've added a red strip that goes around the bottom of the exterior and gave the interior Leather/cloth seats with orange stitching. They didn't make the Soul a race car by any means, they just added an engine that gave it enough power not to feel like you had to floor it everywhere you went. So why would they make it like a kids toy and add stupid little things like that? On to the list of things that are gone.  The front cooled seats are no longer an option and the heated front seats are still there but  now only have 2 heat settings instead of 3. Those items are still available on the Soul +. So instead of getting the Soul ! that used to be the top trim level you're getting a Soul ! that isn't even fully loaded. Still, it is a great car Kia just needs to figure out their color schemes and option availability.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"customer_review_all_engines_wide_mdl_year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 986,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" The SLR is a great car. Its fun, extremely powerful but perhaps a but to hardcore to use anywhere at anytime. The handling is good except for one key factor : the brakes. If you slam on them, gravity is no longer in effect and you feel as though you will soon be through the windshield. Powerful? Yes. Efficient? Somewhat. Unless you need to stop from 150 mph there's really no use in brakes that feel like you've hit a wall. Brakes aside the car is great. The car start buy flipping a switch on the shifter and then the push of a button. Brilliant. Then youve got 626 bhp at your own disposal. Then look at the doors! A crowd is drawn instantly. Hardly any other car can give you as much attention.\",\n          \" I've owned my jeep for 10 years now and it has been as reliable as they come. Starts every time. It's also extremely safe. These things are built like tanks and include a factory roll cage. Anyone looking for a fun vehicle that you can count on should consider a wrangler..  I bought this vehicle used, from a friend.  It needed all of its basic service done for the mileage as it had been neglected in a salt water environment for four years.  After new tires, brakes, tune up and fluid change, I used it for a daily driver.  First the bad:  It is a soft top and is very noisy at anything above 50mph.  It has a harsh ride and has very little storage room inside of the interior.  It also gets terrible fuel mileage. Next, the good:  The vehicle has had rock solid reliability with very few unscheduled repairs, all of which were minor.  The vehicle is also pretty much unstoppable in harsh weather and I have had the opportunity to use it in deep snow, flooding, and hurricane conditions during the time I have owned it.  It is also very good in a crash as I was hit hard on the side at highway speeds and walked away with only a bruised shoulder.  The vehicle was still operable after the crash and I drove it to the body shop for repairs.  It is a niche vehicle and you will either love them or hate them.  If you buy one for comfort or mileage, you will be sorely disappointed,  If you buy them for tough as nails off roading or for the ultimate in bad weather mobility, you will love it. Update... I installed a factory hard top which has improved the comfort of the vehicle substantially as the highway noise level has been significantly reduced and the climate control now has no issue keeping up in extreme weather. I also installed the stock sized tires and rims which improved drivability and slightly increased fuel mileage.  Repairs are starting to. Evonne more frequent, but the old girl now has 120,000 hard miles on the clock..  If you plan on driving on the road all the time and you are very young, maybe this vehicl will do, but it has average gas mileage to be expected from an american SUV and its a rough ride in town. That said if you have time to actually use your jeep for offroading and trail running the jeep wrangler is excellent. I cant imagine trying to take a scion up some of the places I have gone in this jeep, and the soft top and removeable doors are always off. Great to drive at night in the summer here and the improved coilspring suspension is a step up from the older leafspring. Still stiff though, so like I say, its not for the faint of heart..  I'm living in Alaska. Life is good in a Jeep. This vehicle has a soft top which makes it the perfect Alaskan convertible. I have had it for about 4 years now and have great experiences. Never stuck in the snow, never miss the sun, and it even tows my little trailer..  If you are looking for a used Wrangler to use as both a daily driver and a weekend trail runner, the 2003 year is a very good choice. This year saw the intro of the new 4 speed automatic transmission, making freeway driving easier. It had already seen a engine upgrade in 2001, and also now has the option for rear disk brakes (faster stopping, better feel and much easier to repair). Aside from the later Unlimited body extension option and the Rubicon off road package that became available in 2004 (and together in 2005), there is no better Wrangler to consider than a 2003 (Unless you want a fat/wide 2007+, which can't get though some desert canyons I wheel in!).  I have wanted a Jeep Wrangler for a long time. Finally bought a used 2003 and after driving for approximately 20,000 miles I am now experiencing the \\\"Death Wobble\\\" If you haven't had this happen with your Jeep you will!!! No real cure from what I am reading. Have to say I would not recommend buying a Jeep to anyone. Trying to fix the\\u0094 Death Wobble\\u0094 in my Jeep so I can sale the rig..  Purchased the car new, and have used it primarily as a toy.  It has been very reliable and has not required anything but normal maintenance.  This is a great car for weekends and vacations, but I would not recommend it for everyday use.  It is also great in poor weather conditions.  The ride is not super comfortable, but that is expected for the type of vehicle.  The hard-top is difficult to negotiate, and it becomes an ordeal to remove each season.  The exterior metal is thin and dents easily, and the car burns gas at an alarming rate.  I replaced the air filter with K and N, and that improved mileage about 2 MPG.  All that said, I still love my Jeep. .  In 1979 I purchased a '78 CJ5. I also purchased a 1944 willy that same year. I wish I still had both. My latest is a n '03 sport 4wd. I am still a jeepie at heart. I wish more of the jeepies' knew about the \\\"jeep wave\\\".  Happy Jeeping!!.  This is my second Jeep wrangler I had a 2001 sport and I loved it. Just when I thought Jeep couldn't get any better I bought the Jeep I've always wanted (well since 03)  the Rubicon and I'm very impressed with its performance and capability. .  Just bought a used 2003 Jeep, one-owner. Bought it with 36,000 miles on it. LOVE THIS SUV! Everywhere I go, it's great to drive in. Great ground clearance, great handling. Fuel economy is a problem (15mpg mixed). But wouldn't drive anything else! Love it! Really easy to work on!.  There is nothing like driving a Jeep! The Sport is amazing! There are countless clubs and everyone in a Jeep is part of the family. I will never be without a Wrangler in my driveway for the rest of my life, for those of you who don't have one yet, it's a Jeep thing, you wouldn't understand! ;).  I bought the Jeep back in January of 2007. It was not to a few little dings and soft top. I got it in Georgia and I dorve it to North Carolina and latter to Colorado. The thing gets about 18 to 20 mpg on the highway and 15 in town. Right now it has about 90,000 miles on it. The only problem I have had is the trakbar on the front axle. I have had to replace it twice but it happened within 5000 miles of each time it went out and the dealer replaced it free of charge the second time. The stock front bumper is a piece of junk also. I got a tube bumper that looks great and I am going to drive it back to North Carolina when I get back from my deployment..  I had a '83 CJ7 that was bulletproof, and was great to drive. My '03 Jeep, is just as reliable and great to drive, with more comforts of my '83. The fuel economy isn't great, but if I wanted that, I would've bought a Toyota..  Posting this comment to those who might be shopping for a jeep also. Have wanted one since I was 16 and now I am 41--been driving and paying for a Honda Accord for the last 5 yrs and can't wait to trade for a loud, bumpy, \\\"wind in my face\\\" jeep! Might have to work a 2nd job to pay for the jeep's drinking problem, but you won't here me complaining when my husband, Aussie, and I go to N Ga camping and hiking. We are going to get dirty,have dog hair everywhere and a smile on our faces!  Thanks for all the consumer reviews-helps a lot in my decision to trade the Honda to a whining jeep owner. .  Bought the Wrangler brand new in '03 and have never, ever changed anything on it. Seriously, since driving it off the lot, it has not been back to the dealer. Even still has original brakes. I did change out the tires for 38\\\" last year. Great reliability!.  I never thought I'd own a Wrangler.  I was actually looking for a Cherokee when I stumbled across this perfect 2003 X model.  I've never had a vehicle more fun than this.  I drive with a smile everyday.  It actually rides quite well, the seats are fantastic, and the CD player with the factory subwoofer sounds great.  I added stainless bumpers front and rear, a Magnaflow exhaust, and the K&N intake kit.  It sounds excellent, and has better pick up.  Driving it last summer, on a clear warm night, with the top off, I looked up to see the stars going by, and all seemed right in the world, if only for a few minutes.  This vehicle is amazing... especially off road..  I love my Jeep - everything about it. Only thing that I have recently encountered is something called the \\\"death wobble\\\"... pretty scary, but I think we finally got it in order after replacing the track bar and steering stabilizer and found that there was 45 pounds of pressure in one tire and 36 in the other (was that way when I purchased it - unbeknownst to me).  In any event, so far it is back to being \\\"my baby\\\"..  When I was a kid in the 70's my dad had a couple of Jeeps and I have always been a fan.  I finally had the opportunity to purchase a new Jeep in 2003.  I have had absolutely no buyers remorse.  It is my primary vehicle but when ever I have the chance, I take it off road.  The first time I took it off road I knew I was getting exactly what I wanted.  The first snow fall was the second time I knew I had made the correct purchase.  The only problem I have with my Jeep is I have no excuse for missing work during our Pennsylvania winters..  We have owned 3 Wranglers, and 15 other Jeeps. This one is great in the sunshine and the snow, and can be loads of fun. That said, I must say that the gas mileage is horrible (10-13mpg around town); that as soon as it rains it's all over the road; and that the paint quality is the worst I have ever seen on any vehicle, including late '80's GMs. My jeep is babied (hand washed, waxed, etc.), and the paint is still peeling off. Our two grand Cherokees purchased around the same time do not share this problem, so this is something exclusive to Wranglers. Yes, it's a lot of fun, but I wish that Chrysler would have made the Wrangler with more love!.  After 3 years of ownership and more than 35,000 miles of driving in every type of weather, terrain, on-and off-road condition, I have to say that the Jeep Wrangler Rubicon has impressed me as the best built and most capable Jeep that I've owned to date--this one makes Jeep #6.  For a Jeep, the ride is comfortable and the seats allow greater adjustment over past models. The suspension is firm and well matched for both on road handling and off-road articulation.  The hard top and soft top are both made well and equally quiet when driving at highway speeds. The sailcloth soft top is holding up much better than my previous soft tops from earlier TJ models.  This one's a keeper!.  Excellent truck, horrible on gas, easy to do work yourself, pulls large objects with ease (trees, vehicles stuck in mud). Eats gas though and be ready for frequent tire rotations. Also eats starters if you take it mudding..  For years I've wanted to own a Jeep Wrangler, before it became a Wrangler.  When the CJ's were around I thought about purchasing one, but with a wife and growing family it was impossible.  Once the kids were out of the house I worked very hard at finding the ideal Wrangler.  I like the four wheel drive, the style of the body, the simple things about it.  The Wrangler changes on occasion, but you'll alway remember a JEEP before the companies who want to be like them.  JEEP Wrangler one of Americans best, and will be around for many years to come.  Will the wannabes, probably not.  Funny how a WWII JEEP turned into one of America's favorite recreation vehicle.  Take that wannabes..  I love my Jeep Wrangler.  I love the feel of driving it along with just being in it.  It gives you a sense of power because you can sit above the rest of the traffic.  I have modified mine to fit 36\\\" tires with 6.5 inches of lift.  It works wonders offroad..  Happy with everything except disappointed with the engine performance.  It seems that the engine will backfire on a downshift once and a while. The Jeep dealer told me that someone else was complaining about it and that it was bad gas.  So I've tried different gas stations and It's still a problem.  I suspect it's a fuel management issue and is normal for very long straight inline six design.The horsepower is lacking for the size of the six and how much gas mileage you get out of it. I bought the Jeep for the power but 4 cylinder cars passed me in the Rockies. Technologically It seems behind the times, related to engine performance.  Need some R&D for a factory installed supercharger..  This is the first Jeep I have ever owned, and I can't believe I have never had one before now. The slogan, \\\"only in a Jeep\\\" is so true. I have been places in my factory Jeep that I would have never dreamed to take a vehicle. I love this thing. No issues with this at all..  Although this is my second Jeep Wrangler I still can not believe how capable this Jeep is! No matter what the weather or where you are this Rubicon has no problem taken you where you want to go. Classic Jeep interior and exterior lets you know exactly what you are getting yourself into. Interior comfort is not that of a BMW 7 series, but it it a Jeep it is built for functionality and fun. The most capable Jeep EVER built!.  Just passed 30000 miles on my 03 Wrangler. Trouble free. Says alot because I have owned 2 Accords. It is lousy on gas but, it really makes up for it while your driving it. In 4WD snow is not even a  minor inconvenience.  Owning a Jeep puts you in your own class.  No need to compete with someone else on what kind of car you drive. You drive a Jeep, enough said. Taking the rear seats out allows you to store enough for long trips or vacations. Summer is good with the top down, but, driving in the Fall is even better. On long drives its no Lexus but, if you wanted that ride you may want to get a Lexus.  You'll be amazed how quick you get used to roll up windows! .  This is my third wrangler and my fourth jeep vehicle and i've had no problems with any of them..If you get hung up about getting dirt,dog hair,lots of water,beach sand, or dirty kids than this vehicle is not for you.The ride is rough -deal with it!You can count on one hand the things you can do with other vehicles as opposed to a jeep wrangler-stop crying and go buy a honda..  Purchased it gently used with 31x10.5 tires already installed. Rides a lot better than the '97 I had previously driven.  2.4L has better horsepower than older models. Transmission and clutch operate very smoothly. Can hear some clunking into gear, and very stiff in the single digit temps of Iowa winter. High back seats are comfortable for long drives, but don't expect to get much above 65mph with the 4 cyl. Looking forward to spring off-roading..  The build quality of my new Jeep is simply horrific !  With less than 12,500 miles, it has been in the shop no less than 5 times !!  The driving lights went out ( replaced whole harness ), the A/C quit working twice, the airbags quit working twice, engine stalled 4 times and the bumper-ette worked itself loose.  The most annoying thing is the paint quality.  With 3500 miles on it, bug juice removed 117 eraser sized chunks of paint on the grill !!  The dealer ( 2 of them ) refused to declare it a warrenty item.  Chrysler defered exclusively to the dealer.  No other car I've ever had ( over 15, brand new ) ever had this prob.  .  LOVE my Jeep - can't believe I waited so long to get one.  You get the same adventure as a motorcycle only safer!!  I think I'm a Jeep Wrangler lifer!.  I had my jeep for two months but had to trade it in because after SEVERAL close calls, I finally had an accident when it slid into the back of another car on wet roads.  I have no doubt that had I'd been driving a car, it would have stopped - there was plenty of room.  It's also very difficult to see what other vehicles are doing when you are trying to change lanes and merge into traffic.  On the good side though, it was a fun car and the a/c was excellent and got cold very fast..  After my SUV was totalled in an accident, I decided to get the vehicle that I wanted since I was 4 years old - a Jeep.  I am so glad that I did.  I cannot imagine getting anything else in the future.  The Jeep does not have much pickup and not so great fuel economy (I do have the V6) compared to other vehicles, but that is fine by me.  I can deal with that one item for all the other pluses.  .  People tried to discourage me. My dad said it was unsafe, my mom worried, friends said it was not practical.  I AM SO GLAD I did NOT listen! I have never had so much fun!!! It is VERY versatile and can haul a lot. It's been to the beach, camping & highway driving EVERY day. It really has been fun.  It came with a hard top, but I bought a soft top and I cannot imagine putting the hard back on.  The soft top is so versatile and fun.  It stays off all weekend.  AND it is NOT that hard to manage.  I think the Editors' reviews were too harsh-- sound like a dad's review! ENJOY IT.  The SE model with 2.4L I-4 engine is underpowered and uses a lot of gas for an I-4. The engine seems rev happy for an offroad engine. Gearing is awesome in the 5 speed transmission, although 3rd gear could stand to be a bit lower and closer to 2nd's ratio. Highway sppeds in excess of 65mph are hard to reach even on a flat surface during a calm dry day. Design, both interior and exterior, is classic bare basics Jeep. Overall a great car if you are into Jeeps. .  These cars are a \\\"gas\\\" to drive.  You want to throw on aflannel shirt and your hiking boots and head for a field.  The other people who drive them wave to you so you feel as if you are part of some \\\"club\\\". I'm not certain if its a vehicle or a \\\"lifestyle\\\".  I love it so far..  This thing has a personality like no other, and makes Canadian snowstorms a really fun experience.  The mechanical aspects are pretty rudimentary, as the inline 6 growls without putting much power, and has a drinking problem worse than some of my party buddies (from 11MPG in winter to 19mpg in a smooth highway drive). The 4.7 V8 or new Liberty Diesel would most likely be smoother, more powerful and probably better on gas.  Both Hardtop and Soft top are fairly quiet and insulate from the elements. Heater and AC are powerful enough to counter the elements. .     .  My experience with the Jeep Rubicon has been excellent.  The vehicle is built to last and handle even the harshest of conditions.  I live in Maine, and my Jeep will take me anyplace I need to go, in any weather conditions.  It's a fun year round vehicle, with a hard top for the cold winter months, and a convertible soft top for those summer cruises to the beach! .  I have had my 2002 Jeep Wrangler now for almost two years. I absolutely love it! I wish the fuel economy was better due to the fact that I commute about 70 mile round trip every day. But, it has been a blast and great bonding tool for my whole family. We love to camp and go four wheeling off-road. My Wrangler has taken me everywhere I had had the guts and lack of common sense to go.A party on wheels....  I have been a life long fan of the Jeep since my father had one when I was a kid.  I finally was able to purchase one this summer and I must say it is living upto my expectation.  My friend took me up into the mountains this fall between the rocky climbs and the giant mudholes this vehicle is unstoppable.  Most fun I ever had in a car. I used to drive small sports cars, I don't think I will ever go back. Anxiously awaiting our first snowfall so I can have some fun with my dad..  The 2003 Jeep Wrangler X is an excellent vehicle, perfect for mild to moderate off roading. Also with the 4.o 6 cyl. it has the power you need to perform well on or off road. The interior is limiting but well designed for the amount of space available. All the X's controls are easily within reach and head room is in abundance (even more when the top is off). Storage space is a definate downfall unless no one is in the folding back seat..  Most fun you can have with your clothes on (well that is oppional). .  I have had this Jeep for less than two months. It will make its own road in the snow (off road 12\\\" deep up hill with ease), climbs hills with ease,it is awesome off road. It has all the extras that I wanted to put in my older Wrangler, Locking axles, great sound, Coil springs (awesome ride).Who needs an H2, When you could have this awesome Jeep Rubicon! It will go anywhere! With cash left over to buy a winch, trail rack etc..  The best vehicle I have ever owned!.   The owner of two previous Wrangler models a 99 and 01 I was ready to price a brand new 2003 Wrangler.   I truly enjoyed both of my previous Jeeps ,but, each lacked something that I needed to drive for a long time to come.      Now in 2003 Jeep stuffed the venerable 2.4L and 42RLE 4spd auto. This combo gains a net of almost 30HP, and an extra OD gear for the tranny. This combo not only really bring the little \\\"cheap Jeep\\\" option to life ,but, seems to have helped considerably in the economy dept as well. 1200mi since purchase and I have managed 19MPG in mixed driving. My 2001 by comparison was lucky to break 14mpg.   .  Hey all,ive had my jeep since 2000 its a beauty.  they have turning capabilities that of no other! she handles better in the mountain turns than my jetta!  JEEP OWNERS ROCK!!.  I got rid of my SE because it didn't have enough power and purchased an X. As expected, the 6 has much more kick than the 4. The fuel economy sucks, but it's a Wrangler not a Civic. The rebates were great at this time of year and my dealer had a lot in stock. Black with a khaki soft top, sharp!.  For on road fun to drive, for off road I have not found a better 4x4!!!.  I love this car!!!!!!!!!!.  Great Vehicle...Gotta punch it on the highway for passing or else your not getting much of a response, engine is weakest between 1200 and 1900 RPM's ....  My week old Wrangler is the best move this over-worked man has ever made.  2.4L is adequate, better than other 4 cyl I have owned, 5 speed is easy to shift, the hyd clutch is a piece of cake to work, good for beginners.  Wish I had the full doors with window, it would make cool mornings better. It is truly relaxing to drive.  Soft top is not that bad, 10 mins tops to do it right.  I will always own a Wrangler from this point on.  It's a Jeep Thing!!.  I bought a white Sport Model, with a hard top. I was in heaven as I drove it home. I parked it on the driveway and got out. I then noticed a black rubber hose hanging from the back of the car, which God knows for how long I had been dragging. As I inspected the bottom of the Wrangler I noticed a loose piece of plastic, on the back of the passenger\\u0092s side back fender. This piece had flapped out because of a missing screw. In addition, what I believed to be the differential axle was completely covered in rust. I called the dealership and told them to have the car I had just traded in ready because I wanted it back. One hour later I was back in my old car..  This jeep wrangler is an upgrade from your son's california college vehicle that he bought to drive the girls around in.  It has improved ride, easier top, and all the safety features of a \\\"regular\\\" sedan.  It still goes through flooded roads, across fields with the ease of the bigger \\\"monsters\\\" we hear so much about.  Fuel economy is decent.  I love the fact that the back seat folds forward to make the mini truck I wanted when I removed the seat from my old wrangler.  Now I have the best of both worlds as I approach my 60 birthday.  Signed the Blonde Supercharged Outdoors Woman.  Bought this jeep for my wife, she really wanted this color, trim, etc. I could not talk her into a Rubicon, for the same price, although I really love my dad's new one.  She is more about sound systems, fun, and comfort than capability. Hendrick was easy to deal with and she loves her new jeep!.  Just bought a 2003 Inca Gold pearl coat X, I love it. Looks good, drives good. You'll overlook all of it's shortcomings when it puts a smile on your face!.  I LOVE my Jeep. No other vehichle I've owned has given me such a good feeling to drive. The Jeep just feels so right in so many ways. I took her out \\\"wheelin\\\" right after break-in period. I only took her on what wheelers call \\\"the doe run\\\", (easy trails), after all, it is a brand new vehicle. Only modification is bigger tires. (I really don't understand why they even put small tires on at the factory, it just isn't right on a jeep.) I was absolutely amazed at the obstacles I went over easily. After the 2nd worst winter in NY's history with it, and now a hot summer, I can truly say this is a vehicle for all seasons. .  I HAVE BEEN SO PLEASED WITH THE COMPLETE VEHICLE THAT I JUST WENT OUT AND ORDERED A NEW 2004 EXACTLY LIKE MY 2000. I WENT IN TO ORDER A NEW VEHICLE WASN'T SURE WHAT I WANTED, SALESMAN ASKED ME HOW I LIKED MY PRESENT VEHICLE, I TOLD HIM IT DID EVERYTHING I WANTED IN A LEASURE TYPE VEHICLE.  HE ASKED ME IF THERE WAS ANYTHING I WOULD CHANGE.  THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT I WOULD BE GIVING UP IN ANY OTHER VEHICLE I MIGHT BUY LED ME TO ORDER A NEW WRANGLER JUST LIKE THE ONE I WAS TURNING IN.  MY WIFE AND I ARE JUST APPROACHING RETIREMENT AGE BUT STILL LOOK FORWARD TO THE 900PLUS MILE TRIPS WE HAVE TAKEN AND WILL BE TAKING IN OUR JEEP. .  After lusting after one for years Ifinally got myself a Wrangler.  It's aconvertible, an SUV a pick-up, an offroader, it does it all.  If you want aperfect 2nd car and a week end funmachine, you could not ask for more..  After several months with my Jeep, I am very happy with my purchase.  I only wish the weather would cooperate so I could leave my top off more often.  For 2003, the seats were re-designed and they are much more comfortable than prior years.  Total Fun in the Sun!.  The Jeep is definetly a fun filled vehicle. It says \\\"I have no boundaries and nothing to tie me down\\\". If you want a fun car to drive this is it. But keep in mind that this is a brute that will go through some gas quick. With all the technology today you think they could make it a little more gas efficient. Have no doubts, this vehicle isnt made for paved roads, but for the outback. Its only true use isnt in a concrete jungle but four wheeling out in the countryside. As a fun vehicle it has no match, as a city vehicle it could use some modifications..  I have always wanted a Jeep Wrangler but, being in my late 40's, I thought it was a childish fantasy that I should finally put to bed. Then I came to my senses! It's fun, powerful, reliable (so far) and I can go anywhere in it. The 4WD-on-the-fly is easy and quite liberating. I'm short (4'11'') and to finally be able to see more than the back end of another car is one of the best features of this vehicle for me. Sturdiness and safety ratings are another huge plus. The awsome turning radius makes parking a complete breeze. And then there's the \\\"Jeep Wave\\\". It makes you feel at home wherever you are.      .  VERY FUN! VERY CAPABLE! NO OTHER 4X4 COMES CLOSE.(PERIOD).  The car's awesome its fun to drive the gas mileage isnt badd and it's more or less common sense to take apart, everything is just straight out there  no questions. with out a doubt that is a madd fun car to chill in and i recieve compliments left and right. im pickin up girls here and there. its a standard pimp mobile.  .  I currently have a '97 Wrangler Sport. I bought it January 98. I just recently went over 100k miles in it on 7/10/03 @ 5:32pm. Since the day I brought my Jeep home, I HAVE NOT had any problems with it. The body is built tough, to over-ome any obstacle. Actually, the tough-ness of my Jeep kinda saved my life! I was into a nasty hit and run accident in April '03, costing $8k in repairs. My Jeep was thrown about 20 feet onto the side walk and into the bushes. If I was to be in another vehicle,  Thanks Jeep! -Kim H.Houston, TX.  My fiance and I decided to spend the extra cash and go all out with our new Wrangler and get a Rubicon.  I have always driven a Wrangler and when it was time for a new vehicle I wouldnt have chosen anything else.  The Rubicon has everything I would want in off road capabilities and when it comes to traveling, it handles like a dream.  Smooth riding and a turn radius that cant be beat is just the beginning of the Rubicons awesome features.  Worry free off roading in any conditions keeps the fun in driving this Wrangler beast.  Looking forward to some great snow storms this winter!.  This vehicle is really fun to drive and has a supringly great amount of comfort for a vehicle that is based on the premise that it will be used off road. The factory installed enhancements, normally installed after market, are engineered as a system, so this car doesn't misbehave, even at speeds up to 75 mph..  After 12,500 miles with the Rubicon I am still amazed with where it will go and how much fun it is to drive. The Jeep Wrangler is the most fun vehicle to drive built today. The Rubicon Package makes it the most capable off highway vehicle on any dealer\\u0092s showroom floor.  If you don't believe me just give it a try.  Be careful though, you will get hooked.  .  You don't purchase a vehicle like this because you think its going to ride like a car, so don't compare it to a car.  The (5) Speed Manual Transmission shifts like silk with no effort and the steering is highly responsive. This Jeep Wrangler looks great in Silver and I have received numerous complements.  If you want a SISSY CAR with Heated Leather Seats and a high end suspension package then that's what you need to buy.  I traded in a FULLY LOADED, VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT, (6) CYLINDER (5) SPEED for my Wrangler and I don't miss that car at all. .  I've been driving jeeps for 16 years, I used to drive and race motorcycles. A Jeep with it's roof and doors off is the closest thing to the sense of freedom I had. In the winter I look forward to hellish snow storms. It's simply a blast to drive! Overall, you have to love jeeps or you'll hate the ride, interior space, roof hastle (hard and soft)lack of fuel economy and other little quirks!! I'm getting ready for my 2004 jeep, rubicon or sahara? still debating, waiting to see whats new for 2004.ps. I'll probably continue driving jeeps as long as ....  I have had several Jeeps, and this is by far the best one ever.  Traded my Avalanche that I loved in on this, and don't regreat it for a minute.  I have both hard and soft tops, but bought it for no tops.  Absolutely fun to drive anytime anywhere, and it can go anywhere.  Live at the beach, and I couldn't have a more appropriate vehicle.  Thanks Jeep...\",\n          \" Great, fun driving car at the outset when I purchased used @ 24k miles. Spirited and exhilarating performance, superb handling and intelligently laid out interior/instruments. Fortunately I purchased from a dealer and opted for an extended warranty, as I experienced an IMS failure at 38k while traveling cross country. I replaced the engine with a new 06, and have found it to be even stronger, and recently competed another 7,200 mile trip in it. For me, every relationship has it\\u2019s ups and downs, and after having experienced an engine fire in my 1970 911, and owned 2 914\\u2019s in my youth, I can\\u2019t imagine driving any other make!.  My car has been having ignition problems, and it's practically brand new. Porsche engineers should fire themselves--using sub standard parts. All Porsche's are prone to these issues. If you're considering buying a Porsche, don't buy one (and if you're considering going on a road-trip, I would not recommend it). Unhappy customer..  After one year in the saddle and 3,000 miles of pavement conquered, the verdict is in -- superb job Porsche! I sold my 2001 Porsche 911 after a rather enjoyable but just as disappointing two years of ownership. After missing my Carerra for a few months I set out to find a newer and faster Porsche than my 996. I settled on a low mileage Boxster after an unplanned test drive left me quite impressed and smiling. I enjoy it more than my old 996. It sounds great, has good power, handles fine, and has been a joy to own. It has the sports chrono package and an upgraded six speed manual so it is a little more peppy than cars without those options. The engine sounds like a symphony when driven hard - especially when the exhaust echoes off tunnels and wall. Basically, the whole car just feels like a well engineered piece of fun. The car is fairly comfortable also.  However, the car loses some points when the top is up for some annoying transmission noise and loss of exhaust sound and interior noise. I can only imagine what the new models must be like to drive. Well, except for the new version with a 4 cylinder. The Porsche flat 6 is a treasure. For the money, a used Boxster is a great deal..  I purchased my 2005 Boxster in 2006 (then 9,000 miles; now 64,000).I have not looked back since.It is surprisingly comfortable for such a tight-handling car.It looks and feels as mean as it sounds.And to my surprise, maintenance issues have been few (air/oil separator replaced).I could not ask for a better all-around sportcars.I highly recommend the model and year..  I purchased this beauty in April (2011). I Dr. traded it in at 100k miles. He did all the service religiously, and it works fantastically. The manual spoiler switch was broken when I bought it but a part from SunCoast Porsche fixed it. I do the work myself which keeps maint. costs down. I am a simple guy with a simple income but I feel rick driving the Boxster around town. I never put the top up, (I drive an 05' IS300 on rainy days) and I still get 24-25 MPG. I LOVE this thing!.  My wife and I purchased this car for her recently from a friend of ours who collects sports cars.  It's \\\"her\\\" car but I just can't seem to keep my hands off of it.  It's so much fun to drive I'm looking at buying another one just so I don't have to beg her for the keys.  It's cool looking, sounds great, handles like it's on rails and is like riding a bolt of lightening when you push it hard through the gears.  Just plain love it. Thanks Porsche!.  Purchased 2005 Boxster S brand new. Never had any major issues until about 2 years with 20k miles. That's when vehicle had complete engine failure/balance shaft broke apart. Since the car was still under warranty car was towed to my local dealer. I was told the balance shaft broke causing complete engine damage! The dealership service dept had no loaners and I was without the car for 3 weeks. When the car was given back to me interior and exterior was scratched up and steering wheel was off center. I did not want to keep the car and called/meet with Porsche rep to discuss. Porsche N.A. rep would not help at all! Due to poor reliability I traded to Mercedes..  I have been looking and test driving cars for 9 months (long time I know ). Drove vette 5 times, boxster and caymen about 5 times, 911s 3 times, z4, viper etc. The boxster was my favorite bar none (like it more then 911 s) but still couldn't pull the trigger. Well I finally purchased one and my goodness I couldn't be happier. This car is absolutely awesome in every way. It eats curves, the engine sound is better then music, and the build quality is outstanding. The fact that you can stay below 50 mph and have a blast is a big plus also (I don't think you can do that in a viper or vette as they require more room to make you smile IMHO)!.  I had my own problem.  Starting with Engine failure due to broken intermediate shaft.  Dealer took it for few weeks and put a new engine after 21k.  I had few other things going bad but still love my Porsche. Went to dealer probably about 10 times for minor things after that. I will probably get something like GT3 or 997S model next time.  I think they could have done a better interior job but you get what you pay for.  Love my car top down and still able to beat many cars like G35, 350Z, BMW 335ci and many many more.  Can keep up with old M5 and Vantage.  It's pretty impress for the money.  Need grippier tires, like Vredstein..  The 05 Boxster S is the best sports car on the market for the money. Why? It has performance, styling, ride, utility (2 trunks fore and aft), economy (23 mpg overall)and technology (top stores in 10 seconds).I still get positive comments from passersby after 3 yrs with this car..  Leased the 2005 Boxster S in February. Other than sidelight issues and a tire blowout in the upper peninsula of MI that required an excursion via flatbed trailer for 150 miles to the nearest town and a two day wait for the replacement tire it would have been an uneventful trip. The real fun started in the 2nd summer of ownership when the counterbalance shaft snapped in half with 10,127 miles on the odometer. Porsche replaced the engine 6 weeks later at their expense with a remanufactured 2006 version. Michigan summers are noted for their brevity so the six week layup took the fun out of the relationship. I flipped the lease in spring of 2007 and still miss the car. Reliability is an issue..  I love this car. It is my first Porsche and I have it just over 2 years. Will \\\"upgrade\\\" to the 911 soon.  The car has had its problems. After 6,000 miles engine blew for no reason (new engine put in but covered under warranty), clutch went after 7,000 miles (maybe that was the wife driving??).  Now the convertible roof has stopped working and is currently in the shop getting fixed. With all that I still love this car..  After one year, my 2005 Porsche Boxster has been nothing but pure pleasure.  It is amazingly fun to drive..  I have waited a long time to purchase a Porsche. I have not been disappointed in the least. The available power and steering through sharp curves is incredible. I really feel as though I have total control of the car..  This is a fantastically designed ride with one-of-a-kind racecar-like power and handling. The '05 refresh augments the beautiful lines of the classic Porsche and carries those design elements into the interior cabin. .  I had 2002 Boxster (986) and upgraded to 2005 Boxster (987). So far I have 16,500 miles on the new 987. There are so many improvements done to the new model. Besides the obvious new look on both exterior and interior, now a tall person does not have to hunch due to the lowered seat. The gear shifter is shorter and more precise. The suspension is also tighter and feels much better. Overall, I am so glad that I upgraded from the 2002 986 to the new 987. I will probably end up purchasing 988 if such model comes up from Porsche. .  I love this car.  I had a problem with the heating vent directors breaking.  2 of them broke in normal use. The dealer replaced them. They are fine now.  My only complaint - the clothes hanger hooks on the back of the seats are so shallow in depth that you cannot get even one hanger on them.  They are totally useless.  This is a design oversight that needs attention.  Other than that...well, the windstop does rattle a bit, which others have mentioned.  Indeed, it could fit more snuggly.  But hey, this is such a fun car to drive!  Everytime I get in, put the top down, crank the tunes on the Bose system (excellent!) it is like a mini vacation. The '05 model is a huge improvement over previous models..  I owned 986 (2001 Boxster) and just upgraded to 987 (2005 Boxster). The sound of the new model is so much better. The new manual transmission is so tight and precise. The clutch is so much easier to operate than traditional Porsche models. The taller roll bar and lower seat allows tall person like myself (6' 2\\\") to fit in the car much more comfortably than before. I had one modification on my old 986, Becker Radio (CDR2200?) allowed me to install an auxillary line for iPod, but the new fiber optic digital audio system has to have FM transmitter in order to connect your iPod. In other words, the sound quality from your MP3 player really suffers. I guess I will have to begin burning many CDs..  My Porsche Boxster does not have as much muscle as my old 1999 Chevrolet Corvette but it has adequate power for me.  It certainly is a lot more fun to drive and more comfortable. It has no roll on the curves.  It feels like you are attached to the road surface..  I just got my 2005 Porsche Boxster S three days ago.  I'm very impressed with the handling, design, and quality. I'm glad I made the right choice!.  I owned an E46 BMW M3 convertible (current M3 for those who don't know) and this car blows it away.  How can 276 hp beat 333?  It's lighter and handles amazingly through the curves.  I compared it to a Z4 3.0i and the Boxster S won hands down. It's hard to find the limits of this car in a turn, it's just that planted.  And the engine sounds great!  My only regret is I wish I had gotten sport chrono for the remapped accelerator option, but that's not all that important in the scheme of things.  Suggestion to anyone buying one: get a good radar dectector!.  This is my first Porsche and the best car I have ever owned. The main feature that I enjoy the most is taking turns at 65 mph when the yellow caution sign states 30 mph. I have to fight my wife when it comes to who gets to drive and she hates to drive...until now..  This is my first Porsche and definitely the finest automobile I have owned to date. It has been more fun to drive than I imagined and it's quality and engineering continue to impress me..  Traded my 2003 911 on this vehicle as I liked the styling better than the 911 and the performance is near identical at a much lessor price.  Great folding top, nice fit and quiet in cabin.  The mid-engine actually handles better on curves than the 911..  A absolute joy to drive.  It is stylish,responsive and powerful. Distinctly superior to every other car I've owned, which includes not only a current model BMW M3 and an Audi TT 3.2 but also a Porsche 911 (996)..  As a former Corvette fanatic I carefully researched and tested both the C6 Vette as well as the Boxster 987, both are extremely good cars but the Porsche has better handling and comfort as well as storage space, not to mention the acceleration and power. The S model Boxster is even faster! Also insurance premiums are much better than the vette which has a high theft rate. I own the regular version, not the S version and it is without a doubt the best car I have ever driven! Gas mileage is in the range of 22 mpg average. After owning 3 Vettes, Porsche made a believer out of me!.  With the upgrades made to the new 2005 Boxster S, Porsche has made a great car a truly excellent car. The balance and handling of this car is spectacular. Although horsepower is lower than some rivals (i.e a Corvette), the engine is super smooth and pulls really well through most of the rpm range, doing 0-60 in 5.0 seconds. The interior finishing is much better, and the exterior makes the car look a lot more muscular. If I lived in an area with lots of straight, open roads, I might be tempted by a 400+ horsepower car.  However, I live in an area with lots of winding mountain roads and wouldn't choose anything different.  The Elise would handle as well but is too unrefined to drive every day..  The new Porsche Boxster is their \\\"BEST TO DATE\\\" sports car.  Previous models have been fine, but this car is way outstanding.  Fast, Fun to drive, quiet with the top down and you can drop the top while you are driving under 30 mph.  I have had the car for two weeks and it \\\"turns heads.\\\"  Bose stereo is great.  Terrific \\\"Ice cold\\\" air conditioner (a must for Texas). Interior finish work is as fine as Mercedes; very well laid out instrumentation, etc.  I checked out several convertibles and this car was the best all around car..  After owning a 2001 Boxster, I decided to trade it in for a new 2005. I didn't know if the original could be improved. However, the test drive I took definately showed me that the 987 is better than the 986. The car is so much fun to drive. The bump is horsepower is enough to be noticed (especially in sport mode). Great handliing is retained. The interior is very nice! I could not imagine a better two seat roadster. The new updated exterior is gorgeous. Go Porsche!.  This car is a blast to drive.  Puts a smile on your face.  Handling is exceptional and very forgiving.  Power is good, but there are lots of cars that will beat you.  Feels great at speed and is a real confidence builder.  Engine is tied tighly to rest of drive train and is very responsive.  Great looks and a real head turner.  Seats are very comfortable (get the power seat option) and driving position is excellent.  Visibility is great too.  Engine makes that wonderful sound.  Make sure you use premium and a little octane boost does help.  I have had an issue, the passenger side power window stopped lowering when you grab the door handle (needs to do this with the top up, since the window binds)..  Two days ago, the dealership that I have purchased several cars from within the past two years, brought my new Boxster S arctic silver with black top.  I had to drive it off of the flatbed and as soon as I sat down, I instantly realized how much better the seat was than the 2004 model.  Instant comfort!  The interior is dramatically improved and much more comfortable.  I traded an Audi A8L which had comfortable seats, but to be honest, the Boxster's fit my bottom much better with less lateral pinch from the lower seat sides.  The new Boxster seems much more civilized, but with a better exhaust note.  It, as well as the previous Boxster, are much more fun to drive than the 2004 Carrera 4S!.  I was considering a Mercedes-Benz SLK, but after test driving a Boxster S my decision was made! I'm still in the break in period, but this car is a ton of fun to drive. It's also a lot of fun getting all of the \\\"thumbs up\\\" from other motorists and strangers on the street. If your going to spend the money; get the \\\"S\\\" model with as many extras as you can afford. I love this car, and love being a Porsche owner..  In 1999, before Boxster S existed, I bought a new Aerokit Boxster. I had gone from a '98 Carrera S (that roofers dropped a roof on!), to the '99 Boxster. The '99 was a disappointment, lacking ponies under the hood. The 2005 Boxster S is a world apart in 6 years.   I am extremely pleased with the Tiptronic transmission, the acceleration, the handling and definitely the new body style for 2005.  Probably the only disappointment was the $61,000 price tag..  I have a VW Touareg, an Audi TT and a 03 Porsche Carrera and the new Boxster is the most fun to drive and the best of the lot. The fun of the TT Roadster with the legendary Porsche quality and performance.  It's like I mated my Carrera and my TT and the 05 Boxster S was Born!.  I bought the car one week ago and I have about 650 miles on it. The problems that I have encountered in the first week are: the car was delivered low on oil so I had to go out and purchase oil to put in it two days after the purchase, the paint is already coming off the front intake next to the bumper, the convertable roof broke on decline and now no longer works, and the brake warning light has already come on. Truth be told is I get a new car every two years and this will be my first and last Porsche. This is a fun car to drive, but I am questioning build intergrity and quality of craftsmanship. Make sure you research the car well before you buy it and good luck..  Boxster has phenomenal handling and response.  Everything from steering to accelerator to brakes responds to the driver as if it were the extension of the driver.  The mid engine design provides excellent stability.  What I love the most is going 0-42mph in 1st gear and then 42-80 mph in the second gear!.  It has great handling and has great turning.  It can also accelerate very quickly..  I could not imagine my life with out it! I thought my Audi TT was great and before that my BMW but I drove my Boxster cross country in the winter into the northeast and it was a delight! .  I ordered my 2005 Porsche Bosxter with no extras at all; only the most basic car: 5-speed manual, and red in color.  Absolutely no complaint.  The sound of the engine is gorgeous.  The basic car is already good enough as it includes the stability control (an option in the 2004), an on board computer, and the crusie control.  I've had a Mercedes, a BMW, and this is my first Porsche.  Each time, i've been very satisfied with the sales person (however, I hated the Mercedes SLK!).     This car has to be driven. Reading a review does not get it. After being hit from behind and hitting a tree then head on into a concrete wall with the top down, climbing out without a scratch this is one safe car so state farm wrote us a check and we got another one. So far so good but I use my mirrors more.This is a real sports car.Drive It!.  Looked at Z4 and even the new 911, but I thought the Boxster had the best styling. New 280 HP engine just rips and mid-engine design make handling world-class.  Seats are very comfy, the automatic top (with glass rear window) is awesome.  Boxster used to remind of SLK--a bit of a girl's car. No more--new Boxster is one of the world's best sports cars..  Greatly improved ext/int. Good responsive acc & handling.  The new Boxster is now a \\\"complete Boxster.\\\"  Every little aspect of this car has been improved.  While many will not notice the exterior changes, the design is much better executed.  The interior is worthy of a car of this reputation.  The new Boxster S is truly one of the most intensely, pleasurable driving experiences I have ever enjoyed.  Even if I could afford its bigger brother, I would not justify the 911 over the Boxster.  Kudos to Porsche..  Great car. Overall perfect. Porsche could have made it a little faster and more powerfull but overall its a great car. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":67}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"1IDUgk992lPO"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# categorize and summarize all loaded user reviews"],"metadata":{"id":"5NFwguzsNDwz"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def categorize_and_summarize_specific_user_reviews (row):\n","    start_time_all = time.time()\n","    debug = 0\n","\n","    time_summarize_3 = 0\n","    time_summarize_2 = 0\n","    time_summarize_1 = 0\n","    time_categorize_1 = 0\n","    time_categorize_2 = 0\n","\n","    if isinstance(row, pd.DataFrame):\n","      car_manufacturer  = str(row.iloc[0, 0])\n","      car_model_year    = str(row.iloc[0, 1])\n","      base_model        = str(row.iloc[0, 2])\n","      engine            = str(row.iloc[0, 3])\n","      user_reviews_particular_engine = str(row.iloc[0, 4])\n","      user_reviews_all_engines = str(row.iloc[0, 5])\n","\n","    elif isinstance(row, dict):\n","      car_manufacturer = row['car_manufacturer']\n","      car_model_year = row['car_model_year']\n","      base_model = row['base_model']\n","      engine = row['engine']\n","      user_reviews_particular_engine = row['customer_review']\n","      user_reviews_all_engines = row['customer_review_all_engines_wide_mdl_year']\n","\n","    else:\n","      raise ValueError(\"Input must be a DataFrame or a dictionary\")\n","\n","    # Create a Summarizer instance\n","    summarizer = Summarizer()\n","\n","    if (debug):\n","        print (f\"\\\n","            car_manufacturer  = {car_manufacturer}\\n   \\\n","            car_model_year    = {car_model_year  }\\n   \\\n","            base_model        = {base_model      }\\n   \\\n","            engine            = {engine          }\\n   \\\n","            user_reviews_particular_engine            = {user_reviews_particular_engine          }\\n   \\\n","            user_reviews_all_engines            = {user_reviews_all_engines          }\\n   \\\n","            \")\n","\n","    summarized_review_of_this_model = \"n/a\"\n","    review_particular_engine  = \"n/a\"\n","    current_model_review_all_engines_engines             = \"n/a\"\n","    current_model_review_all_engines_interior            = \"n/a\"\n","    current_model_review_all_engines_mpg_running_costs   = \"n/a\"\n","    current_model_review_all_engines_practicality        = \"n/a\"\n","\n","    if (len (str(user_reviews_all_engines)) > 10):\n","\n","        if  (len (str(user_reviews_particular_engine)) > 10):\n","            #retreive all user reviews for specified configuration\n","            #categorize_and_summarize_text all user reviews for engine  (done for summarize_engines)\n","            start_time = time.time()\n","            concatenated_text_particular_engine =  categorize_text2(user_reviews_particular_engine, TargetTextSize = 1000,  debug=0)\n","            end_time = time.time();

This suv has super visibility, ride, comfort, handling and even performance. It gets over 20 mpg on the highway. If it had a 6 or 8 speed transmission  it would come close to today\\'s vehicles.  This the BEST CAR EVER for my family..  We bought this car from an original owner with about 90,000 miles on it. I had read about the transmission issues but this car had just had a complete transmission replacement from Volvo at 87,000 miles. We felt like we would get another 100k or so out of the replacement. Turns out we were wrong. At 130k the transmission started slipping and we traded it in on a new car. During the 40k miles we owned it we also had to replace the rear bearings and the front drivers side drive shaft. We also put a new headliner in. When it was running it was a great riding car. Handled snow great and was a beautiful car. Just too many issues that cost $$$.  158000 and running strong well kept maintenance done regularly nice smooth rides good for young kids GPS is a plus back up system great has been a dependable vehicle as long as you keep meaning sometime and check for the normal wear car will last you a long time.  Oh boy, let\\'s see, bought the 2004 xc90 T6 last year 2014 with only 72K miles on it,good deal right!? WRONG! The transmission \"fell out\" about 3 months after owning it.  We had a HUGE thunderstorm, which lead to a flood in the Volvo due to the seal on the sunroof needed to be cleaned.  Back Breaks and drums needed to be replaced a few months later.  Then no real problems for about 6 months, and then it wouldn\\'t start. The techs couldn\\'t figure out why? Put in a new started, bought a new key, and it still wasn\\'t starting, 11 months later, GOT RID OF IT!  Traded it in .. I wasted close to $7,000 plus in repairs, and lost on it when I traded it in. DO NOT BUY the T6 I should of done my research.  Have had this thing now for 10+ years and 90,000 miles.Went from primary car for hauling two kids to a third car that sits outside and is reserved for \"dirty work\".Have been lucky enough to avoid any engine and transmission problems but the cost of multiple failed wheel bearings, sway bars, and ignition coils have really mounted - especially for a relatively low-mileage vehicle.Still, the fact that we still have this car says a lot about it. It is extremely versatile, in terms of hauling people and stuff.It has always started and never broken down.And one thing about the Swedes - they know how to make safe cars that can drive through snow!Ten years old and does not look dated..  Wow, this is a great car to drive, unfortunately, everything breaks on it.I normally don\\'t post, but I just had to register to let people know.Here is the short list of things:2004 T6, first owner: Front (both) and rear (both x 2) shock mounts (not shocks, the stupid plastic pieces they put in there). Motors in the dash for the air. Replaced two of them now.$$$ Driver window motor.$$The rain drains on the roof got plugged up, when they overflow, it goes onto one of the computers on the driver side.$$$Turbo is now dead $2000, and the traction/stability computer is dead.$$$ Rear wheel bearings $$ plus the tires they ruined.I won\\'t own another volvo, ever..  Do Not buy this car!I was enamored by the nice look, the safey reputation, and the fun drive of this car.And despite warnings on this and other review sites, I went ahead and bought it.I got a used one for $10k.After a year of in-and-out of the mechanic, and countless $$\\'s spent on repairs, I finally junked it when the last repair estimate came to $11k.You would not believe how many \"car experts\" asked me how stupid I was to buy that car.Big...waste...of...money!Please do not buy this car.Don\\'t be tempted like I was.You will regret it.I guarantee..  Bought a used xc90 from volvo. We have averaged a new problem every 2000 miles. Including a breakdown leaving my pregnant wife stranded and now flickering headlights that cant be fixed despite visits to the dealership and throwing money at it. (computers and modules are next on the list) It would be nice if the dealership looked like they knew how to fix what is apparantly a common problem on their vehicles... So its going to be traded in with a 6 mth loss of 5-6k. Looks pretty but its not engineered well nor built well - certainly not the volvos of old. .  I bought my xc90 used and the problems didn\\'t start til about 85k miles. Then I started having to replace wheel bearings, control arms, and ball joints. Then my car hit 100k miles and literally as soon as the odometer rolled over, my driver side headlight went out due to an electrical issue, then the alternator went, battery needed replaced, serpintine belt, timing belt, tempeture gauge housing, crank shaft assembly, and now at 101k miles on my way to look for a new car, my car starts smoking and my turbo blew which on the t6 is a twin turbo. I have been towed 3x in 3 weeks and everytime I go to get rid of it something else goes. I am having it junked and taking a loss on what I still owe..  VOLVO YOU HAVE SOLD A LEMON TO YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS AND THAT WILL CAUSE YOU TO SUFFER GREATLY. This 2004 Volvo xc90 has been a nightmare for me. I spent over $2600 dollars this summer and it continues to add on up.my dash board turns off and i lose power to the rear of the vehicle. This makes this AWD car become FWD!! doesnt make sense but its true and i cant even open my gas door and i have to open it manually from inside. THIS IS THE WORST CAR!! Yesterday the tail light on the passenger went out and some of my front right lights too. \"multiple bulbs failure\" today i start it and they are all working. WHY do this to your customer VOLVO! VOLVO IS LIFELESS!!! .  We loved our 2004 T6 until yesterday when we had to be towed from Lake Tahoe to a Sacramento Volvo Dealer ( 109 miles ). Two different dealers told me this model has a huge transmission problem. There is talk of a law suit on the discussion board as so many owners have had problems. To be fair, some of the owners got full replacement including trnsmission, lines and radiator (around $7000 n). We\\'ll see how it goes ....  Absolutely love this SUV. Best vehicle I have ever own, hands down. Safe. Reliable. Kid friendly. Just all sound great SUV..  I have an 04 Volvo XC90 and had the bad experience of the Transmission Service Urgent light coming on and the vehicle putting itself into \"limp mode\" to stop further damage.  Of all the blogs I read after this happened, most of them had negative outcomes as far as support from Volvo.  I had a great experience and wanted to share that Volvo covered 100% of my damages.  I am getting a new transmission, new radiator and new lines installed.  I called Volvo\\'s customer service line.  I was assigned a customer care rep that was extremely pleasant and helpful.  She worked with the Volvo dealer and I had a response in 2 hours of the 100% coverage including the diagnostic fee.  Volvo: 1-800-458-1552.  Volvo is Swedish for junk. Worst car I have ever owned. Horrible service - Constantly breaking down. Needs a new transmission at less than 60,000 miles. New Turbo\\'s. New head gasket. Burns through tires, oil, and brake pads, latches and locks have broken.  If you are looking to be unhappy about your ride it is the car for you!  Remember, friends don\\'t let friends by Volvos!  If you buy one of these cars there is one of you born every second (sucker) otherwise Volvo would go the way of Dodo bird..  From the beginning gas leak inside the car repaired by dealer. General western warranty all but worthless on most costly parts. Spring seats not covered. Electronic module not covered ABS not covered. Cost thousand of dollars. Every maintenance check is $400 or more, and you must maintain or waste warranty. Is that reliability in our auto world today?.  We bought our 2004 xc90 nov. 2007 with 57,000 and it has been a great SUV. Very strong but when the transmission light went on at 87,000 I was not a happy customer. We called the Volvo dealer and they told us to bring it in. They were very helpful and we have a \"brand new\" transmission at no cost, yet it doesn\\'t have \"manual\" anymore. a lot of drama but it\\'s driving well and I cant complain .  I would not buy this vehicle again.  Have replaced almost the entire suspension of the this vehicle and the transmission failed twice, once at 60K miles and again 6 months later.  As other customers have said, the customer service was awful.  .  This vehicle is hands down the most elegant, smooth, and did I say smooth vehicle I have ever driven. The seats are so comfy, and the steering wheel just feels like silk! But then the transmission issue. Do not buy a t6 awd unless it has had the transmission upgrade! I bought one used now I\\'m looking at $8,000.00 in repairs. Volvo knows it\\'s a huge prob and will pay for parts in some cases. .  I hate this car! Bought new, all options but the GPS, over $50K. At 200 miles needed a new fuel tank, original was cracked. Here\\'s what went wrong: Xenon headlight fogged replaced, almost killed myself because they were pointing down, night visibility after reinstall of the new ones was 10 feet! Then the tail lights leaked filled with water, replaced, power steering unit, replaced, computer replaced, fuel tank door fell off 2X\\'s, windshield wipers broke, CD player and back-up signal beeper stopped working, brakes after 20K miles, tires every 22K miles, water filled the roof, wanted $900 to remove interior to let it \"dry out\"! Suspension bushings needed replacement, & on & on. I HATE IT!.  I purchased this vehicle used with 107,000 miles. I should have checked Edmunds reviews 1st. At 117,000 miles, just like previous reviews - transmission problems. Cost for replacement, $6,000 and only a one year warranty. .  My 04, XC90 is a tank; in a good way.  Handles great in the snow and any wet weather and most assuredly can tear up the pavement.  The third row seating could use more room, but after all it is a midsized suv.  This is my 5th Volvo and 7th in two generations.  I have 167,765 miles on my vehicle with the original transmission and turbos.  Tires have come and gone, but the brakes have only been replaced once. As far as cost of upkeep...I bought a Volvo. No one who buys a Benz complains about price. .  I\\'ve bought my 04 XC90 believing the car was reliable. Later to find out the first month I had it the transmission light appear. the transmission had to be replaced a long with the radiator and later the radio had to be replace as well next the driver side window track had to be replaced then the doors would open while driving on it\\'s own while locked. A few months later the steering wheel became loose, it cost me ninty dollars to have it tighten.  The transmission I can some what understand because it was made by GM. I thought I bought a car without an American part. Unfortunately not so. This will haunt me for the life of this car. The brakes and tires well it\\'s a heavy car big deal!.  Do NOT, NOT buy this model. I got it with little more than 80Kmiles, for less than 3 months and I am experiencing severe transmission problems. I made some research about this type of problem and it seems that most XC90s, specially 2005 and early have this transmission problem. The worst part is that the warranty I bought it with, will not cover until after 90days of the purchase. It was a good car until the transmission issue experience. .  My fiance\\'s 2004 T6 AWD Volvo has 250,000 miles and it drives like it\\'s brand new. It\\'s had no problems (just regular maintenance). He changes the oil regularly and uses premium gas. His dad (a small business owner) has two newer Volvos he purchased as company cars that have also racked up some miles, and they also drive wonderfully. My fiance and his dad absolutely love Volvo XC90\\'s and this lead me to purchase one for myself. I recently bought a used 2004 2.5T FWD with 53,000 miles and I love it so far. I hope she also makes it to 250,000!.  Overall I had an excellent experience with my Volvo XC90.  I had some of the same issues in that I had to replace the brake pads and tires frequently, but I do mostly city driving with a lot of stop and go.  I had no major problems until December of 2009.  The check engine light went on.  It was time for the 60,000 mile tune-up and when they changed the spark plugs and coil, everything was fine for about 2 weeks. Then the engine light came back on.  It took an overnight stay and a cold start for them to find the issue;a cracked gasket head!!  There had been no warning signs, no running it hot, nothing!  The repair cost of $6000 made me decide to trade it for the new XC60 T6 AWD. I miss it :(.  I am the original owner of this car.  We paid MSRP (I know, I know).  The car is loaded and was fabulous for about a year.  We have had to replace all four tires 4 times, brakes 4 times, transmission, rear bearings.. engine problems, key fob problems, seat belt problem, water leaking...  You name it, we\\'ve had it.  The ONLY thing we did right was buy the extended warranty. Has saved us $10k, easily..  My wife and I ordered our XC-90 through a local dealership then went over to Sweden to test drive it for a week. Volvo shipped it back for us 10 days later. The vehicle has been perfect for the past 6 years. I am however, quite concerned with all the negative reviews here. Of all the vehicles I\\'ve owned throughout my life, I must admit that this XC-90 beats them all by far..  Do not buy this year xc90 under ANY circumstances. Had it one and a half months, transmission exploded. Car has low miles (45,000) and I bought the aftermarket warranty. They will not cover the loss due to a clip failure in the transmission, which fails due to a too short lube tube from the pan. Thumbs way down. .  This car looks great, seats 7 semi- comfortably, is great in the snow, and will spend as much time in the shop as on the road.  O2 sensors out at 50k. Spark plugs needed replaced at 50k.  Transmission needed replaced at 61k.  Volvo service won\\'t stand behind the car.  I was told directly that \"Volvo for life\" is \"Just a slogan.\"  Don\\'t let the pretty looks and solid reputation fool you.  The newer Volvos are trouble.  Expensive trouble at that..  Worst and final Volvo I will own. I purchased i in 2007, NOTHING but trouble. Over 2,500 in repairs to front end, and then the transmission went at 79k At this point I traded it in on a Chevy Tahoe Z71. Much happier and haven\\'t had nearly as much trouble.  Volvo customer service and dealership were horrible. I have owned 4 Volvo\\'s and after this experience I will never buy Volvo again. Nothing but problems. VERY dissatisfied..  I really like my XC90. While it has had some minor issues, overall it has been a pleasure to own.  After driving this vehicle in LA, i got rear ended badly (the Lexus was totaled that hit me) and my XC90 was a tank. I can\\'t say enough good things about his vehicle.  .  We bought  this car new. This has been my favorite car to drive. We bought it because it had all the safety features that we wanted which were ahead of it\\'s time, it\\'s nice size, and it\\'s towing capacity. Despite the practical reasons for buying this car, it is fun! The power is incredible. It has phenomenal acceleration even at high speeds on the highway.  It is usually no contest, even against other sport sedans. I have had this car for five years and 80,000 miles.  It is the only car that I have loved for more than a couple years, and it is just as fun as the day we bought it. .  This is our 6th Volvo. Smooth and comfortable on the highway. We keep up with the maintenance and have the transmission fluid flushed annually. Best mileage was 23.4 mpg on the highway with premium 93. Most filling stations add 10% ethanol now which has lowered our fuel economy averages. .  If I had to do it all over again I wouldn\\'t. This vehicle has been nothing but problems. Brakes wear too fast, the first brake job was at 6,000 miles, I have 23,000 and need new rotors and pads. The steering makes noise and has always, I was told it was normal. Then after the warranty was up I had to have the front steering fixed, ball joints and the rack. now the steering only makes fluid noise but still a pain. The radio is the worst ever. The best part is the safety, but with the poor fuel economy, the multiple problems, the very poor resale value I should have went with the BMW. For some reason my wife wants to keep it.  I can only expect more problems as time goes on. .  I should have seen the sign. When I went to buy the car back in 2004, I had picked out the exact model I wanted, then while I was filling out paperwork, I was notified one of the doors did not open. After another Identical model was found, I took it home. 8500 miles later it needed brakes. Seats showed wear at 10000 miles. Then soon after, the passenger door started popping open. There have been numerous leaks, including a cracked power steering reservoir. Many noises started popping up, a transmission leak appeared, the Volvo dealership rarely fixed problems the first time. Now, because of this, at 47000 miles, the car is in need of a new transmission. Volvo now must replace the radiator..  This car is in the shop about once a month. Luckily we bought the extended service warranty as the build quality is on par with some of the first generation Korean models. Some the failures are real safety concerns. I guess the positive if the parts do fail and result in accident you know you will be safe.   .  Bought this car used a year ago with ~30K miles on it to replace a \\'00 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I loved the XC90. It is so fun to drive, looks great, has great options (heated seats, navi, dvd, wood steering wheel, etc), was comfortable to sit in, and had no big problems. Only in the shop once when I thought it was making a funny noise. Dealership was great, it was still under warranty so they fixed noise and a couple other things (stereo light had gone out).  Had two kids with car seats in the 2nd row.  Access to the 3rd row was hard, but you really can\\'t fit a human being in the 3rd row anyway. Better to keep the 3rd row down for more cargo room. Sadly totaled this car but it kept us safe!'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":73}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!nvidia-smi\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"rAIY5UQrl10J","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711026763669,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Roman Zhvanskiy","userId":"11978303123960557609"}},"outputId":"f1a15bd0-9e35-4418-9de4-a803e8d912ed"},"execution_count":74,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Thu Mar 21 13:12:43 2024       \n","+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","| NVIDIA-SMI 535.104.05             Driver Version: 535.104.05   CUDA Version: 12.2     |\n","|-----------------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n","| GPU  Name                 Persistence-M | Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

Wow. This car never fails to put a smile on my face, I have owned this car for 2 years and I've never had a problem with it other than regular maintenance, almost right away I replaced the stock tires for more stick tires, and wow does this car like to corner! It's straight line speed it kind of lack luster but then again it was not really made for that. It loves to accelerate out of corners and while doing so it still feels like you are riding in luxury! On the highway I get great MPG, not so much in the city though. Getting in and out of the car is a little bit of a hassle but is immediately worth it once you sit down..  What a fun car from a  Corvette owner also.  Built her on-line in 2006, found her with everything except the gray interior (has Camel). At 65,000 miles Mary Jane has to have her front Boots repaired.  Not bad for ten years. Great road car in snow and rain.  Has open sky, very fun option.  Has Bluetooth, CD, and Cassette player.  Perhaps will not sell for these options alone.  Has the active headlight option where the lights are just ahead of your turns. It is also the S-Line quattro with 18 inch fancy wheels. Has things and functions if not used on a regular basis, one has to get out the book to remember what does what. Everything still works fine. Perhaps one of the most fun things is being able to put the rear seats down for hauling a family of dogs or whatever.  Excellent road car, but not the best mileage. can achieve 30 mpg if one does not go over about 68 MPH.  They only put six forward gears in this racing transmission.  They now have seven to eight gears in the new Audi models.  At highway speeds the motor should not be turning more than about 2000 RPM's.  Would prefer about 1750 @ 70-75 MPH.  It is turning over 3000 RPM......a killer for mileage.................Very cool, good looking, functional car anyway.  Much better looking than the sedans for me..  Bought a used one that had 100 K.Owned for 3 days and I am impressed. First I regretted of having bought such a small car (low ceiling) but, the rear seats are actually roomier than many other compact cars. Price was about half of the cheaper new compact cars, so I am saving quite a lot. Perhaps I will end up using up all these savings repairing this car. But, the car is so lovely that I don't mind doing that. .  I bought the 2007 Audi A3 used. It was a 1 owner car with 68k miles on it. The car was clean and beautiful! I drove it for 4 months before I traded it in and lost 5k on the trade in deal alone. The AC system failed, and it caused the motor to over heat. Saved the motor, but I had to replace the entire AC system. Cost me $1700 bucks! The rear power window broke. Window went down and never came back up. Cost me $450.The glass top sun roofs are a great idea until you see how HOT the inside of the car gets from the sun beaming down on it. I live in the south and that little car was never \\\"cool\\\" inside. The cup holders are a joke, you cant fit more than 1 drink period! .  Although my Audi A3 is fun to drive and handles well, I am extremely disappointed by the frequency and cost of repairs, and cost of maintenance.My 2007 A3 has only 79k miles but I have spent about $4,000 in repairs in maintence in the past two years.That is inexcusable and not something I expected from a supposedly high end auto manufacturer.Actively looking for a new car..  As a 40 year old driver, i have had alot of vehicles, mostly American, some Asian. I purchased a 1 owner 80,000 mile 2007 A3 2.0T. It is the best car i have ever owned. for those of you driving arround in American or Japanese cars...you are really missing out on \\\"real driving\\\" this entry level Audi runs circles around the big 3's flagship cars. Fun to drive, reliable, quick, and Quality, Quality, Quality. I will now only consider European cars. And Audi is the best bang for your buck in quality, luxury, style and covers every need. At 80,000now 95,000 miles it is mistaken for brand new by people on the street. No problums doing 50-70 miles 7 days a week. I LOVE THIS CAR!!.  Ibis White, S-Line Black Leather Interior with 6- speed Manual Transmission.  Amazing looking car - inside and out - received many compliments - even from people in other cars and pedestrians!  Fun to drive, although steering will be nicer if  stiffer at higher speeds.   Great handling - have driven very well defensively in the crazy traffic in LA.  Navigation with the knob takes too long and needs time to learn - although the DVD update makes it very accurate and quick.  Good power for a 4 cylinder engine!  Luxury car - can be expensive to maintain and repair if out of warranty.  This is a great driving car. I don't particularly care for FWD, but it does handle great! Fun to drive, great MPG, 26-27 in normal, mixed driving and recently 32 mpg at 75 mph on a road trip. The DSG has been as enjoyable as I thought it would. I cannot compliment the \\\"interior experience\\\" of this car enough..great driving position, comfortable, relatively quiet (now that I've replaced the original P6 tires), excellent drivability and great brakes. 4 banger is quiet and smooth..  The A3 is a very stylish, powerful, and gas efficient \\\"mini\\\" wagon.  With a chip and performance downpipe, I was able to make 230hp and 263tq at the wheels.  I have the S-Line w/ Technology package 2.0T FSI and some of the major known problems are as follows: 1. Divertor valve tearing (easy to remedy w/ new piston-type revision valve) 2. Burning oil (varies from car to car but personally I only add 1qt per 5000 mi) 3. Clogging intake valves due to the nature of direct injection (fixed by running a catch can set-up) 4. Cam follower wear on high pressure fuel pump (this is a wear item that should be changed out every 30k and check every oil change, only $50 part but VW/Audi won't tell you that)..  We got the A3 because it was fun to drive and was a luxury wagon.   Last week my husband was stopped in traffic on the highway and was rear ended by a Dodge Caravan going 50-60 MPH.   The A3 is a total loss with over 19,000 in visual damage alone.   The safety features in this car can't be beat, while my husband has some injuries he was able to walk away from a serious multi-vehicle accident..  I bought this A3 with 7000 miles and it displayed very little wear. After driving it for a month in icy and snowy conditions I am very impressed. The stock all season tires get the job done but the fronts are worn a good bit. There are no rattles and the s-tronic transmission works very well. Handling is excellent and the mileage is decent considering the power and weight, about 20mpg in mixed winter driving. The A3 tends to be very touchy when accelerating from a stop, it's jerky and hard to achieve a smooth getaway. The brakes are excellent. Overall, I'm very pleased with the interior quality and look of the A3. I drove the 2.0 turbo and I feel the V6 is considerably better..  Have an A4, love it, decided to get an A3.  Worse mileage than our truck, turns 3000 RPMs at highway speed, can't even make 10MPH in 1st gear.  TERRIBLE design point. We've contacted Audi, they blame everyone else (dealer, etc) -  but it is the worst design I have seen in 30 years of buying cars.  Lighter than the A4, same power (V6), smaller, and about 10MPG worse than the A4 - blows my mind.  We won't touch Audi again - due to Audi USA refusing to discuss, acknowledge, suggest fixes (ie, different gear ratio in the differentials).  By the way, I'm an engineer, have extensive auto experience....  I purchased the premium package with the white exterior and dark grey interior.  This is a good looking car, BUT I have had so many problems with it.  Exteriorly, the trim on the sky system keeps on popping off.  I had to bring my vehicle in 4 times to get this fixed.  The Pirelli tires that come stock are terrible! I had to replace the fronts under 20000 and the rear 25000.  Now I am having engine problems with the transmission.  Recommendation: don't purchase this vehicle! Also very noisy while driving past 60 mph especially if you get the roof racks, which are also junk.  Mine broke the first week I got them. .  The car seems pricey for an A3 sized chassis, but the car seats everyone comfortably. The hatchback also can fit a lot. I bought a big grill at Home Depot and the sales associate looked at me like I was crazy for thinking the grill in its box would fit in my car. It did. Hatchback closed. The car accelerates and handles great. I do seem to go through tires a bit, and I've been told that by mechanics that the A3 does seem to chew up the front three tires faster than normal..  It has been very reliable. There are none of the squeaks or rattles identified in other reviews. It brakes confidently. Steering is wonderful and acceleration makes it plenty quick without being stupid fast. What the reviews don't tell you is that this is the ultimate city car. Compact, practical, quick and stylish. Yet it will pour itself done a twisty back road with verve. It's only weakness is touring on US freeways. For that you need something heavier with a longer wheel base. But since 90% of my driving is in the city, I couldn't be happier with my choice.  Beware of the clutch take up on the DSG transmission. It is set agressively. .  This is a great, versatile car. It offers  a fun to drive, economical vehicle that can also hull a large amount of equipment, especially with the rear seats folded down. I don't think any other car on the market has all of this. I purchased the S-line with just about every option available. I can't imagine living without rain sensing wipers now. Which leads to my dilemma.  I will have to replace this car before the warranty runs out.  I have had three major issues with the vehicle with a total down time of well over a month, and this within the first year of ownership. I hate to say it, but I cannot recommend this car based on its poor reliability..  I love this car.  I have approximately 6000 miles on it.  I like the feel of the car - very nicely done - and the pick up, but the engine noise is a bit loud.  The manual says to shift earlier - right.  I am a bit disappointed about having to choose between the Ipod plug or Sirius.  For this kind of money you would think they could figure out how to include both options together.  I really love the sun roof and moon roof.  The drive is smooth and the seats are comfortable.  I drove everything from the Fit to the A3 and by far this was the best car if you are looking for a hatchback.  The only problem I have had was a bad sensor in the fuel tank set off the engine light, but it was fixed..  I bought my A3 because I wanted a vehicle with smaller dimensions than my '98 Passat, but I wanted many of the qualities I enjoyed in the VW that I didn't find in Japanese or American vehicles. The dimensions for parking in crowded Seattle is a blessing. The acceleration performance is wonderful, and handling is very good but not great. The practicality is what I wanted. I finally was convinced that it made sense to now own an auto trans mainly because of the excellent 6-spd. twin clutch auto. I realize I could have purchased a VW Rabbit/Golf GTI with many of the same qualities and features for far less, but I wanted the more premium features of the Audi, and I prefer its exterior design..  The A3 is delightfully deceptive, looking small on the outside but airy and roomy inside and appearing underpowered by a 2 liter engine but providing more get up and go than many larger engines.  In addition, it's beautifully assembled and it handles like a true sport.  Fuel efficiency is good, averaging 29 mpg. The iPod interface works well, the sound system is super, the steering responsive and sure, and the wipers clear without clatter or skipping.  .  I have had my A3 for over a month and absolutley love it.  The only option I wanted and got is the Open Sky System, which has worked pretty much flawlessly.  I've been averaging between 29 and 30 miles per gallon (highest slightly over 32, lowest slightly over 26).  Runs fine on 89 octane and hasn't required the addition of any oil.  Cargo room seems endless (I can fit two large laundry baskets behind the rear seats without having to fold them down).  I have noticed an occasional light rattle in the driver's side A-pillar, and, when approaching speeds of 80 mph, a humming noise from the passenger side of the front sunroof.  Also, parking brake is obstructed when front armrest is down.    .  Finally got rid of my SUV for this joy.  Drove it on 1200-mile (both ways) trips and seats were comfortable enough not to have to stop every 2 hours, fuel economy was impressive, and you feel like you are glued to the road at highway speeds.  Trunk space leaves a little to be desired since you can't even fit golf clubs back there without folding the seats down.  Great car though. Wish you could get the options offered on the web at the dealerships without having to buy the entire packages..  Coming off a zippy Mazda RX-8 sportscar, I really was dreading switching to the A3.  I thought that a \\\"wagon\\\" really could not be that fun to drive, or perform well.  I was wrong.  The 2.0T with the DSG transmission and the S-line package is a blast to drive.  The steering is a bit light for my tastes (the RX-8's was perfect, so maybe I am just spoiled), but handling, acceleration, power and shifting are all top notch.  The Open Sky package was not one I wanted, but I now find it a great way to make the driving experience more enjoyable.  The only gripes I have are the control system is a bit too complex and maybe the seats could be a hair more comfortable.  Fuel economy is great though..  Car has open sky, premium, illumination and cold weather package.  A blast to drive.  Great engine/transmission.  Great acceleration.  Ride is solid and tight. Steering feels great. Interior design is excellent.  Sound system is great.  Like a video game on the highway; quick downshift (not that you have to) and 80 becomes 100 in a blink.    .  I upgraded from a very unreliable, but fun to drive, manual, VW Jetta 1.8T.  I was nervous about staying in the VW brand but the second I drove the A3, I knew I had to buy it.  I thought I'd miss the manual tranny by getting the DSG, but it's more manual transmission than automatic and I don't miss the stick at all.  The interior quality is outstanding, the seats are not as comfortable as the A4, but still fine for daily driving.  The Open Sky system is a splurge, probably not worth the 1100 MSRP sticker price, but I couldn't imaging the car without it.  Golf Clubs don't fit in the back without the seats being folded down, but there is a ton of rear passenger leg room.  .  It's light, powerful, precise, well-balanced and stops well.  Great mileage in Drive mode, wildly fun on mountain roads in Sport mode.  Bluetooth and see-around-corners lights and seat heater work well. Very comfortable for driver.  Premium comes with good electric seat - for the driver only. Passenger seat manually adjust with big wheel to tilt seat, like our 87 VW Cabriolet - this is a horrible method. Air conditioner works fine on first trip.  If restarted when warm, air wants to freeze you, so it ceases to be automatic. Bose stereo is great, but CD changer is very hard to reach and ther is no iPod input!  And no workaround except FM transmitter, which is not good in saturated FM market..  Purchased my A3 2.0T after much research and driving the competition. I kept coming back to the A3, and so glad I did. This little vixen grows on you. The DSG, coupled with a very flat torque curve, makes acceleration so effortless that I find myself glued to the rear view mirror. I don't think \\\"Audi made me do it\\\" would stand up in court. Fit and finish is incredible. The sound system is very good (I wanted premium but settled for stock, and no complaints). I've been doing the conventional break-in (vary your speed) and still averaging 27 mpg. Overall I'd have to say this is the finest car I've ever owned. If I win the lottery, I'm going for an A8, but still keeping my A3!.  I wanted a 4-door hatchback for flexibility but didn't want to compromise on performance or drive a huge wagon around. There are a lot of sedans in this price range, but the hatch and folding seats give much more utility. I settled firmly on the 2.0T after reviews and test drives, even though it lacked AWD. I drove the 3.2 solely to prevent buyer's remorse and curiosity afterwards, and that was the one I had to get. Outside the trip I took to break it in, I've put more than 2K miles on it in 3 months and that is with restraint (daily commute is <10 miles RT).  It is much more fun to drive than my last car (01 Grand Prix GTP) and sometimes I drive past home and just keep going..  I bought my Audi about 9 month ago.  It is an ok car overall but very poor quality.  So far, I've replaced radiator, check engine light went on twice, and constantly have to add more oil to the car because \\\"Low Oil\\\" light goes on.  These are just major problems.  It is still fun to drive (when it is not in the shop) but it doesn't perform as new anymore.   Another thing to mention is fuel economy.  I though it would be an economical car.  The gas mileage is great on the highway ( about 29 mpg) and is horrible in the city and stop and go traffic, where I get about 15 mpg!!  Considering that you have to buy premium gas, there's no savings.  Also, the car is very loud and noisy..  I drove the 3.2 All-Wheel drive but preferred the 2.0T.  The 2.0T was more responsive and felt torquier down low. Impressive after coming from a VR6 GTI.  I wasn't sure I could give up the MT for the DSG but after driving the car for a couple of days there was no going back to a MT for me. I drove this car back to back with a Mazdaspeed3 and with the DSG I could drive the A3 faster than the Mazda on the same course.  The A3 is just too easy to drive fast with DSG.  There is some road noise as others have commented on which I atribute to the tires and stiff sport suspension.  The ride is very good given the handling abilities of the car. The fit and finish is first in its class..  Have only had this car for a week, but I have already put it through its paces.  I'm impressed!  It handles like it is bolted to the road.  I have taken twisties at insane speeds and this car hasn't broken a sweat.  Combine this competence with a basic but flawless interior, a great stereo, very good gas mileage and totally solid build quality and I just can't see what Audi could've improved.  They completely naile this one!  If I ever get tired of driving this car, you best believe I will be seriously considering another Audi!.  Okay, so I just bought my new A3 3.2 AWD Quattro today after driving the Volvo S40 T5 and the Acura TL-S.  The Volvo was nice, but not in the same class, and the Acura was a great car, but a bit bigger than I wanted.  The Audi is an awesome car.  So much fun.  Some folks say that the power gain in the 3.2 isn't worth the increased price.  My feeling (having driven both) is that the 3.2 provides a much more steady power (no lag) and is better suited to the AWD.  I felt the same way when I chose my VW GTI VR6 over the 1.8T a few years back.  Steady power from the very low RPMs.  Beyond that, the build quality is great, the nav system is awesome, and I'm smiling!.  I traded an 04 R32 for the A3 and haven't been disappointed yet.  It has good performance and is fun to drive fast or slow.  DSG is just great.  .  I love this car, we dumped our Touareg off and never looked back. That thing was cursed! Our A3 is a great addition to our garage, utility, and fun at the same time. If you are over 6'3\\\" I would go bigger but  at 5'11\\\" I fit just fine. Totally recommend this car..  This fall will be two years in my A3 and this car is the best small car I have ever owned.  Great all season driver!!.  Since I bought my brand new car I never got more than 16 MPG, the gas cover got locked, the back of the front seat fell, it ran out of of oil more than 5 times, the 5th door froze and was impossible to open, the tires wore out - $1,000 to replace them! - the stick shift locks in the worst moments, it is so noisy inside you can not hear the radio, open the window when raining, all the water goes inside because of bad design, every time you want to open the front window, you open the rear one because of bad design. NOT WHAT YOU THINK YOU ARE BUYING - THIS IS EXPENSIVE JUNK!!  .  Black on black, manual, open sky premium pkg, cold-weather pkg, purchased in December '06 after much research. The fit and finish tipped the scales.   This car is such a blast to drive and gets noticed in traffic. Engine has great power, and the car handles like a dream. The traction control was put to the test during a recent ice storm and came through with flying colors. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another.   .  My daily commute is 152 miles a day.  Its a little noisy on some roadways.  Overall it's a blast to drive. I was recently driving through 40 mph winds at 75 mph and the car stayed glued to the road. Front wheel drive handles well in the snow..  After 6 months and various trips and weather conditions the DSG A3 keeps going strong. With regular DSG manual shift mode or \\\"S\\\" auto mode we see 24-26 MPG regularly. Unsolicited guests comment on the smooth shifts and strong acceleration. 80 MPH comes too easily on crowded highway jaunts with minimal road noise - keep an eye on the speedometer in Ohio. Snow saw the traction control readily as the wide Pirellis floated and spun. May need winter snows if really interested. Quattro would be nice with the 2.0T. Saw the \\\"check engine light\\\" after a severe temp swing but several key starts apparently reset it before the dealer got a shot. Near 7000 miles and no warranty returns. Fun and sporty..  As the owner of an '05 S4 Cabrio, I am a bit spoiled. When it came time to buy a winter and commuting car, I decided to test drive the A3 2.0T with DSG. Honestly, I am not sure which car is more fun to drive! The DSG is such a seamless AT that the car just wants to go, and has almost undetectable shift lag. Put that together with the supreb handling, unparalleled Audi cabin, and high fit and finish overall, and you have one sweet little ride. The hatch and knock-down back seats make it a pretty versatile car as well. My 14 year old keeps telling me about all the chips and performance equipment we could throw at it, but why bother? It runs circles around most cars on the road as it is..  Torque steer is nearly absent, dive/squat is absent.  Nice power, but could probably use another 30hp. Good pulling power down low for a turbo.  Turbo lag is absent. DSG needs to be revised so that it holds the gear at redline in manual mode. Brakes are intially soft which dosen't inspire much confidence.  However, the car is extremely well balanced for a front wheel drive car and is very, very fun to drive.  Rear cup holders are useless and frail.  Otherwise the interior is very thoughtfully organized.  Needs MP3 aux. input in base stereo.  .  When I first saw this car I wasn\\u0092t in the market for a new car. I was driving a GTI 2002 and was pretty happy with it until I saw the A3 and fell in love with the looks. Then I drove it, wow!!! No other car has the full time all wheel drive and this much power to boot. The transmission is outstanding. You just point it in the direction you want it to go and it goes with precision handling, dry or wet surface. And sport mode brings the car to another level. I am a big fan of a good 6 speed manual transmission, until I drove this car in sports mode. Everything a manual transmission does without the human error. Perfection. I can\\u0092t wait for an S3 or an SR3, hoping it will come out..  Like others, I got rid of my SUV but still wanted a \\\"hauler\\\".  I have loved the A3 since I first saw it and the test drive was great.  The car is amazing.  Look out!  In first the tires squeal.  The power (and efficiency) of the 4 cyl is amazing.  The DSG is a great fun.  Once driving, a guy in a Mercedes followed me to a stop light to tell me what a \\\"cool\\\" car it is.  The nav system, while a bit complicated, is great.  How did I live without it before?  Great car.  I'd recommend it to anyone.  Kill your SUV and get this.  You'll be glad you did.  Don't let anyone call it a \\\"wagon\\\".  .  Test drove Honda, Subaru Outback, Mazda CX 7.  Drove the A3 and knew this was the car for us (well, it's actually my wife's car).  We live in an area where straight roads are rare and curves are the majority.  The 6 speed manual is the smoothest and easiest I have ever driven.  Living in the mountains, I vowed never to own a 4 cylinder car.  But the 2.0 Turbo climbs up long grades in 6th gear with no problem.  Steeper grades I have to shift between 3rd, 4th and 5th gears and that just means I am in for whole lot of fun.  My wife calls this my mid-life crisis car but she looks pretty hot driving it herself.  .  Bought the car with DSG, premium and open sky. Red exterior, black interior. The car looks hot, people stare at it all the time. Great performance, great pickup. The   mileage has been great so far, going to tahoe from the bay I avg 29.3, coming down I did 28.5 (i was going a little faster). I'm 6'3\\\" and fit well, don't have a whole lot of head room, but it's not an issue. Wish the trunk was a little bigger so my dog could fit a little better (great dane mix), but folding the seats will take car of that. Too bad it doesn't come with quattro in the 2.0T. I would highly recommend this car, it just puts a huge smile on my face everytime I take a turn or press the accelerator.  .  Tired of the stiff ride in my Crossfire, I needed a bit more room and ease of entry. Enter the A3. Just as fast with a turbo 4 banger as the XFire, and a \\\"softer\\\" sporty ride. Quicker than my wife's 2001 TT, the A3 can pass life's slowpokes with ease, yet makes for a nice \\\"everyday\\\" ride. I can get all the nine luggage pieces of my drum set in easily with the rear seats folded down...and still have room for a friend. Great car for city, highway or the twisties when you can. A month of driving the A3 and it's still love!.  A great car that combines function with fun. I've had my A3 for about a month and couldn't be more happy.  The 200 HP engine and DSG live up too the hype, and man, does it fly.  The interior is spacious, comfortable, with a clean design. We searched most entry-level luxury sedans but the A3 was the clear winner - nothing even compared to the driving performance of the A3.  You wouldn't know if from the inside, but the car has a ver small footprint, ideal for city driving and parking..  Third Audi, coming on the heels of a 2001 TT and an '03 A4.  This is the Goldilocks car:  not too small, not too big, just right.  Our commute got shorter this year, so this is basically a city car.  Shopped the 330i, the IS 350, the new A4, and the G35.  Loved the A3's functionality and nimble, cut-and-thrust attitude..  This is my forth Audi, through All Roads and A-4 Avants. $ for $ and pound for pound the best car Audi makes excepting for the discontinued All Road and the A-4 Cabrolet converible which is some $ 12K more expensive to equip.  I can do 35-37 mpg with a wax job and no head winds, so I can barely eek out 550 miles to a 13 gallon fill before hitting reserve, but if you want to hold 80 mph on 65 mph interstates and zip past some others in the passing lane, the economy will still hold 28 to 30 mpg. While it does not have some of the useless \\\"bells and whistles\\\" of the A-4 cousin, it's all all around functional car with plenty of storage.  Suggest you buy Continental Extreme Contacts, a great all season/snow tire with smoother ride..  What a blast to drive! Short story \\u0096 I needed to trade in the 330CIC and get something a little more practical as I was losing my winter driver (16 yr old got her permit) and my wife wouldn\\u0092t dare part with her MDX. After a lengthy search I decided to go back to Audi (have owned 3 in the past) to drive the A4. I noticed the A3 and it was love at first stomp on the gas peddle!  The DSG is unreal (paddles are fun), pick-up (turbo lag? NOT) is explosive and car is extremely comfortable. Gas mileage is great (30.5 on a recent road trip) & the creature comforts are nice (open sky, cold wthr, premium pkgs.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"customer_review_all_engines_wide_mdl_year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Its mechanics are identical to a Volkwagen GTI.

Wow. This car never fails to put a smile on my face, I have owned this car for 2 years and I've never had a problem with it other than regular maintenance, almost right away I replaced the stock tires for more stick tires, and wow does this car like to corner! It's straight line speed it kind of lack luster but then again it was not really made for that. It loves to accelerate out of corners and while doing so it still feels like you are riding in luxury! On the highway I get great MPG, not so much in the city though. Getting in and out of the car is a little bit of a hassle but is immediately worth it once you sit down..  What a fun car from a  Corvette owner also.  Built her on-line in 2006, found her with everything except the gray interior (has Camel). At 65,000 miles Mary Jane has to have her front Boots repaired.  Not bad for ten years. Great road car in snow and rain.  Has open sky, very fun option.  Has Bluetooth, CD, and Cassette player.  Perhaps will not sell for these options alone.  Has the active headlight option where the lights are just ahead of your turns. It is also the S-Line quattro with 18 inch fancy wheels. Has things and functions if not used on a regular basis, one has to get out the book to remember what does what. Everything still works fine. Perhaps one of the most fun things is being able to put the rear seats down for hauling a family of dogs or whatever.  Excellent road car, but not the best mileage. can achieve 30 mpg if one does not go over about 68 MPH.  They only put six forward gears in this racing transmission.  They now have seven to eight gears in the new Audi models.  At highway speeds the motor should not be turning more than about 2000 RPM's.  Would prefer about 1750 @ 70-75 MPH.  It is turning over 3000 RPM......a killer for mileage.................Very cool, good looking, functional car anyway.  Much better looking than the sedans for me..  Bought a used one that had 100 K.Owned for 3 days and I am impressed. First I regretted of having bought such a small car (low ceiling) but, the rear seats are actually roomier than many other compact cars. Price was about half of the cheaper new compact cars, so I am saving quite a lot. Perhaps I will end up using up all these savings repairing this car. But, the car is so lovely that I don't mind doing that. .  I bought the 2007 Audi A3 used. It was a 1 owner car with 68k miles on it. The car was clean and beautiful! I drove it for 4 months before I traded it in and lost 5k on the trade in deal alone. The AC system failed, and it caused the motor to over heat. Saved the motor, but I had to replace the entire AC system. Cost me $1700 bucks! The rear power window broke. Window went down and never came back up. Cost me $450.The glass top sun roofs are a great idea until you see how HOT the inside of the car gets from the sun beaming down on it. I live in the south and that little car was never \\\"cool\\\" inside. The cup holders are a joke, you cant fit more than 1 drink period! .  Although my Audi A3 is fun to drive and handles well, I am extremely disappointed by the frequency and cost of repairs, and cost of maintenance.My 2007 A3 has only 79k miles but I have spent about $4,000 in repairs in maintence in the past two years.That is inexcusable and not something I expected from a supposedly high end auto manufacturer.Actively looking for a new car..  As a 40 year old driver, i have had alot of vehicles, mostly American, some Asian. I purchased a 1 owner 80,000 mile 2007 A3 2.0T. It is the best car i have ever owned. for those of you driving arround in American or Japanese cars...you are really missing out on \\\"real driving\\\" this entry level Audi runs circles around the big 3's flagship cars. Fun to drive, reliable, quick, and Quality, Quality, Quality. I will now only consider European cars. And Audi is the best bang for your buck in quality, luxury, style and covers every need. At 80,000now 95,000 miles it is mistaken for brand new by people on the street. No problums doing 50-70 miles 7 days a week. I LOVE THIS CAR!!.  Ibis White, S-Line Black Leather Interior with 6- speed Manual Transmission.  Amazing looking car - inside and out - received many compliments - even from people in other cars and pedestrians!  Fun to drive, although steering will be nicer if  stiffer at higher speeds.   Great handling - have driven very well defensively in the crazy traffic in LA.  Navigation with the knob takes too long and needs time to learn - although the DVD update makes it very accurate and quick.  Good power for a 4 cylinder engine!  Luxury car - can be expensive to maintain and repair if out of warranty.  This is a great driving car. I don't particularly care for FWD, but it does handle great! Fun to drive, great MPG, 26-27 in normal, mixed driving and recently 32 mpg at 75 mph on a road trip. The DSG has been as enjoyable as I thought it would. I cannot compliment the \\\"interior experience\\\" of this car enough..great driving position, comfortable, relatively quiet (now that I've replaced the original P6 tires), excellent drivability and great brakes. 4 banger is quiet and smooth..  The A3 is a very stylish, powerful, and gas efficient \\\"mini\\\" wagon.  With a chip and performance downpipe, I was able to make 230hp and 263tq at the wheels.  I have the S-Line w/ Technology package 2.0T FSI and some of the major known problems are as follows: 1. Divertor valve tearing (easy to remedy w/ new piston-type revision valve) 2. Burning oil (varies from car to car but personally I only add 1qt per 5000 mi) 3. Clogging intake valves due to the nature of direct injection (fixed by running a catch can set-up) 4. Cam follower wear on high pressure fuel pump (this is a wear item that should be changed out every 30k and check every oil change, only $50 part but VW/Audi won't tell you that)..  We got the A3 because it was fun to drive and was a luxury wagon.   Last week my husband was stopped in traffic on the highway and was rear ended by a Dodge Caravan going 50-60 MPH.   The A3 is a total loss with over 19,000 in visual damage alone.   The safety features in this car can't be beat, while my husband has some injuries he was able to walk away from a serious multi-vehicle accident..  I bought this A3 with 7000 miles and it displayed very little wear. After driving it for a month in icy and snowy conditions I am very impressed. The stock all season tires get the job done but the fronts are worn a good bit. There are no rattles and the s-tronic transmission works very well. Handling is excellent and the mileage is decent considering the power and weight, about 20mpg in mixed winter driving. The A3 tends to be very touchy when accelerating from a stop, it's jerky and hard to achieve a smooth getaway. The brakes are excellent. Overall, I'm very pleased with the interior quality and look of the A3. I drove the 2.0 turbo and I feel the V6 is considerably better..  Have an A4, love it, decided to get an A3.  Worse mileage than our truck, turns 3000 RPMs at highway speed, can't even make 10MPH in 1st gear.  TERRIBLE design point. We've contacted Audi, they blame everyone else (dealer, etc) -  but it is the worst design I have seen in 30 years of buying cars.  Lighter than the A4, same power (V6), smaller, and about 10MPG worse than the A4 - blows my mind.  We won't touch Audi again - due to Audi USA refusing to discuss, acknowledge, suggest fixes (ie, different gear ratio in the differentials).  By the way, I'm an engineer, have extensive auto experience....  I purchased the premium package with the white exterior and dark grey interior.  This is a good looking car, BUT I have had so many problems with it.  Exteriorly, the trim on the sky system keeps on popping off.  I had to bring my vehicle in 4 times to get this fixed.  The Pirelli tires that come stock are terrible! I had to replace the fronts under 20000 and the rear 25000.  Now I am having engine problems with the transmission.  Recommendation: don't purchase this vehicle! Also very noisy while driving past 60 mph especially if you get the roof racks, which are also junk.  Mine broke the first week I got them. .  The car seems pricey for an A3 sized chassis, but the car seats everyone comfortably. The hatchback also can fit a lot. I bought a big grill at Home Depot and the sales associate looked at me like I was crazy for thinking the grill in its box would fit in my car. It did. Hatchback closed. The car accelerates and handles great. I do seem to go through tires a bit, and I've been told that by mechanics that the A3 does seem to chew up the front three tires faster than normal..  It has been very reliable. There are none of the squeaks or rattles identified in other reviews. It brakes confidently. Steering is wonderful and acceleration makes it plenty quick without being stupid fast. What the reviews don't tell you is that this is the ultimate city car. Compact, practical, quick and stylish. Yet it will pour itself done a twisty back road with verve. It's only weakness is touring on US freeways. For that you need something heavier with a longer wheel base. But since 90% of my driving is in the city, I couldn't be happier with my choice.  Beware of the clutch take up on the DSG transmission. It is set agressively. .  This is a great, versatile car. It offers  a fun to drive, economical vehicle that can also hull a large amount of equipment, especially with the rear seats folded down. I don't think any other car on the market has all of this. I purchased the S-line with just about every option available. I can't imagine living without rain sensing wipers now. Which leads to my dilemma.  I will have to replace this car before the warranty runs out.  I have had three major issues with the vehicle with a total down time of well over a month, and this within the first year of ownership. I hate to say it, but I cannot recommend this car based on its poor reliability..  I love this car.  I have approximately 6000 miles on it.  I like the feel of the car - very nicely done - and the pick up, but the engine noise is a bit loud.  The manual says to shift earlier - right.  I am a bit disappointed about having to choose between the Ipod plug or Sirius.  For this kind of money you would think they could figure out how to include both options together.  I really love the sun roof and moon roof.  The drive is smooth and the seats are comfortable.  I drove everything from the Fit to the A3 and by far this was the best car if you are looking for a hatchback.  The only problem I have had was a bad sensor in the fuel tank set off the engine light, but it was fixed..  I bought my A3 because I wanted a vehicle with smaller dimensions than my '98 Passat, but I wanted many of the qualities I enjoyed in the VW that I didn't find in Japanese or American vehicles. The dimensions for parking in crowded Seattle is a blessing. The acceleration performance is wonderful, and handling is very good but not great. The practicality is what I wanted. I finally was convinced that it made sense to now own an auto trans mainly because of the excellent 6-spd. twin clutch auto. I realize I could have purchased a VW Rabbit/Golf GTI with many of the same qualities and features for far less, but I wanted the more premium features of the Audi, and I prefer its exterior design..  The A3 is delightfully deceptive, looking small on the outside but airy and roomy inside and appearing underpowered by a 2 liter engine but providing more get up and go than many larger engines.  In addition, it's beautifully assembled and it handles like a true sport.  Fuel efficiency is good, averaging 29 mpg. The iPod interface works well, the sound system is super, the steering responsive and sure, and the wipers clear without clatter or skipping.  .  I have had my A3 for over a month and absolutley love it.  The only option I wanted and got is the Open Sky System, which has worked pretty much flawlessly.  I've been averaging between 29 and 30 miles per gallon (highest slightly over 32, lowest slightly over 26).  Runs fine on 89 octane and hasn't required the addition of any oil.  Cargo room seems endless (I can fit two large laundry baskets behind the rear seats without having to fold them down).  I have noticed an occasional light rattle in the driver's side A-pillar, and, when approaching speeds of 80 mph, a humming noise from the passenger side of the front sunroof.  Also, parking brake is obstructed when front armrest is down.    .  Finally got rid of my SUV for this joy.  Drove it on 1200-mile (both ways) trips and seats were comfortable enough not to have to stop every 2 hours, fuel economy was impressive, and you feel like you are glued to the road at highway speeds.  Trunk space leaves a little to be desired since you can't even fit golf clubs back there without folding the seats down.  Great car though. Wish you could get the options offered on the web at the dealerships without having to buy the entire packages..  Coming off a zippy Mazda RX-8 sportscar, I really was dreading switching to the A3.  I thought that a \\\"wagon\\\" really could not be that fun to drive, or perform well.  I was wrong.  The 2.0T with the DSG transmission and the S-line package is a blast to drive.  The steering is a bit light for my tastes (the RX-8's was perfect, so maybe I am just spoiled), but handling, acceleration, power and shifting are all top notch.  The Open Sky package was not one I wanted, but I now find it a great way to make the driving experience more enjoyable.  The only gripes I have are the control system is a bit too complex and maybe the seats could be a hair more comfortable.  Fuel economy is great though..  Car has open sky, premium, illumination and cold weather package.  A blast to drive.  Great engine/transmission.  Great acceleration.  Ride is solid and tight. Steering feels great. Interior design is excellent.  Sound system is great.  Like a video game on the highway; quick downshift (not that you have to) and 80 becomes 100 in a blink.    .  I upgraded from a very unreliable, but fun to drive, manual, VW Jetta 1.8T.  I was nervous about staying in the VW brand but the second I drove the A3, I knew I had to buy it.  I thought I'd miss the manual tranny by getting the DSG, but it's more manual transmission than automatic and I don't miss the stick at all.  The interior quality is outstanding, the seats are not as comfortable as the A4, but still fine for daily driving.  The Open Sky system is a splurge, probably not worth the 1100 MSRP sticker price, but I couldn't imaging the car without it.  Golf Clubs don't fit in the back without the seats being folded down, but there is a ton of rear passenger leg room.  .  It's light, powerful, precise, well-balanced and stops well.  Great mileage in Drive mode, wildly fun on mountain roads in Sport mode.  Bluetooth and see-around-corners lights and seat heater work well. Very comfortable for driver.  Premium comes with good electric seat - for the driver only. Passenger seat manually adjust with big wheel to tilt seat, like our 87 VW Cabriolet - this is a horrible method. Air conditioner works fine on first trip.  If restarted when warm, air wants to freeze you, so it ceases to be automatic. Bose stereo is great, but CD changer is very hard to reach and ther is no iPod input!  And no workaround except FM transmitter, which is not good in saturated FM market..  Purchased my A3 2.0T after much research and driving the competition. I kept coming back to the A3, and so glad I did. This little vixen grows on you. The DSG, coupled with a very flat torque curve, makes acceleration so effortless that I find myself glued to the rear view mirror. I don't think \\\"Audi made me do it\\\" would stand up in court. Fit and finish is incredible. The sound system is very good (I wanted premium but settled for stock, and no complaints). I've been doing the conventional break-in (vary your speed) and still averaging 27 mpg. Overall I'd have to say this is the finest car I've ever owned. If I win the lottery, I'm going for an A8, but still keeping my A3!.  I wanted a 4-door hatchback for flexibility but didn't want to compromise on performance or drive a huge wagon around. There are a lot of sedans in this price range, but the hatch and folding seats give much more utility. I settled firmly on the 2.0T after reviews and test drives, even though it lacked AWD. I drove the 3.2 solely to prevent buyer's remorse and curiosity afterwards, and that was the one I had to get. Outside the trip I took to break it in, I've put more than 2K miles on it in 3 months and that is with restraint (daily commute is <10 miles RT).  It is much more fun to drive than my last car (01 Grand Prix GTP) and sometimes I drive past home and just keep going..  I bought my Audi about 9 month ago.  It is an ok car overall but very poor quality.  So far, I've replaced radiator, check engine light went on twice, and constantly have to add more oil to the car because \\\"Low Oil\\\" light goes on.  These are just major problems.  It is still fun to drive (when it is not in the shop) but it doesn't perform as new anymore.   Another thing to mention is fuel economy.  I though it would be an economical car.  The gas mileage is great on the highway ( about 29 mpg) and is horrible in the city and stop and go traffic, where I get about 15 mpg!!  Considering that you have to buy premium gas, there's no savings.  Also, the car is very loud and noisy..  I drove the 3.2 All-Wheel drive but preferred the 2.0T.  The 2.0T was more responsive and felt torquier down low. Impressive after coming from a VR6 GTI.  I wasn't sure I could give up the MT for the DSG but after driving the car for a couple of days there was no going back to a MT for me. I drove this car back to back with a Mazdaspeed3 and with the DSG I could drive the A3 faster than the Mazda on the same course.  The A3 is just too easy to drive fast with DSG.  There is some road noise as others have commented on which I atribute to the tires and stiff sport suspension.  The ride is very good given the handling abilities of the car. The fit and finish is first in its class..  Have only had this car for a week, but I have already put it through its paces.  I'm impressed!  It handles like it is bolted to the road.  I have taken twisties at insane speeds and this car hasn't broken a sweat.  Combine this competence with a basic but flawless interior, a great stereo, very good gas mileage and totally solid build quality and I just can't see what Audi could've improved.  They completely naile this one!  If I ever get tired of driving this car, you best believe I will be seriously considering another Audi!.  Okay, so I just bought my new A3 3.2 AWD Quattro today after driving the Volvo S40 T5 and the Acura TL-S.  The Volvo was nice, but not in the same class, and the Acura was a great car, but a bit bigger than I wanted.  The Audi is an awesome car.  So much fun.  Some folks say that the power gain in the 3.2 isn't worth the increased price.  My feeling (having driven both) is that the 3.2 provides a much more steady power (no lag) and is better suited to the AWD.  I felt the same way when I chose my VW GTI VR6 over the 1.8T a few years back.  Steady power from the very low RPMs.  Beyond that, the build quality is great, the nav system is awesome, and I'm smiling!.  I traded an 04 R32 for the A3 and haven't been disappointed yet.  It has good performance and is fun to drive fast or slow.  DSG is just great.  .  I love this car, we dumped our Touareg off and never looked back. That thing was cursed! Our A3 is a great addition to our garage, utility, and fun at the same time. If you are over 6'3\\\" I would go bigger but  at 5'11\\\" I fit just fine. Totally recommend this car..  This fall will be two years in my A3 and this car is the best small car I have ever owned.  Great all season driver!!.  Since I bought my brand new car I never got more than 16 MPG, the gas cover got locked, the back of the front seat fell, it ran out of of oil more than 5 times, the 5th door froze and was impossible to open, the tires wore out - $1,000 to replace them! - the stick shift locks in the worst moments, it is so noisy inside you can not hear the radio, open the window when raining, all the water goes inside because of bad design, every time you want to open the front window, you open the rear one because of bad design. NOT WHAT YOU THINK YOU ARE BUYING - THIS IS EXPENSIVE JUNK!!  .  Black on black, manual, open sky premium pkg, cold-weather pkg, purchased in December '06 after much research. The fit and finish tipped the scales.   This car is such a blast to drive and gets noticed in traffic. Engine has great power, and the car handles like a dream. The traction control was put to the test during a recent ice storm and came through with flying colors. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another.   .  My daily commute is 152 miles a day.  Its a little noisy on some roadways.  Overall it's a blast to drive. I was recently driving through 40 mph winds at 75 mph and the car stayed glued to the road. Front wheel drive handles well in the snow..  After 6 months and various trips and weather conditions the DSG A3 keeps going strong. With regular DSG manual shift mode or \\\"S\\\" auto mode we see 24-26 MPG regularly. Unsolicited guests comment on the smooth shifts and strong acceleration. 80 MPH comes too easily on crowded highway jaunts with minimal road noise - keep an eye on the speedometer in Ohio. Snow saw the traction control readily as the wide Pirellis floated and spun. May need winter snows if really interested. Quattro would be nice with the 2.0T. Saw the \\\"check engine light\\\" after a severe temp swing but several key starts apparently reset it before the dealer got a shot. Near 7000 miles and no warranty returns. Fun and sporty..  As the owner of an '05 S4 Cabrio, I am a bit spoiled. When it came time to buy a winter and commuting car, I decided to test drive the A3 2.0T with DSG. Honestly, I am not sure which car is more fun to drive! The DSG is such a seamless AT that the car just wants to go, and has almost undetectable shift lag. Put that together with the supreb handling, unparalleled Audi cabin, and high fit and finish overall, and you have one sweet little ride. The hatch and knock-down back seats make it a pretty versatile car as well. My 14 year old keeps telling me about all the chips and performance equipment we could throw at it, but why bother? It runs circles around most cars on the road as it is..  Torque steer is nearly absent, dive/squat is absent.  Nice power, but could probably use another 30hp. Good pulling power down low for a turbo.  Turbo lag is absent. DSG needs to be revised so that it holds the gear at redline in manual mode. Brakes are intially soft which dosen't inspire much confidence.  However, the car is extremely well balanced for a front wheel drive car and is very, very fun to drive.  Rear cup holders are useless and frail.  Otherwise the interior is very thoughtfully organized.  Needs MP3 aux. input in base stereo.  .  When I first saw this car I wasn\\u0092t in the market for a new car. I was driving a GTI 2002 and was pretty happy with it until I saw the A3 and fell in love with the looks. Then I drove it, wow!!! No other car has the full time all wheel drive and this much power to boot. The transmission is outstanding. You just point it in the direction you want it to go and it goes with precision handling, dry or wet surface. And sport mode brings the car to another level. I am a big fan of a good 6 speed manual transmission, until I drove this car in sports mode. Everything a manual transmission does without the human error. Perfection. I can\\u0092t wait for an S3 or an SR3, hoping it will come out..  Like others, I got rid of my SUV but still wanted a \\\"hauler\\\".  I have loved the A3 since I first saw it and the test drive was great.  The car is amazing.  Look out!  In first the tires squeal.  The power (and efficiency) of the 4 cyl is amazing.  The DSG is a great fun.  Once driving, a guy in a Mercedes followed me to a stop light to tell me what a \\\"cool\\\" car it is.  The nav system, while a bit complicated, is great.  How did I live without it before?  Great car.  I'd recommend it to anyone.  Kill your SUV and get this.  You'll be glad you did.  Don't let anyone call it a \\\"wagon\\\".  .  Test drove Honda, Subaru Outback, Mazda CX 7.  Drove the A3 and knew this was the car for us (well, it's actually my wife's car).  We live in an area where straight roads are rare and curves are the majority.  The 6 speed manual is the smoothest and easiest I have ever driven.  Living in the mountains, I vowed never to own a 4 cylinder car.  But the 2.0 Turbo climbs up long grades in 6th gear with no problem.  Steeper grades I have to shift between 3rd, 4th and 5th gears and that just means I am in for whole lot of fun.  My wife calls this my mid-life crisis car but she looks pretty hot driving it herself.  .  Bought the car with DSG, premium and open sky. Red exterior, black interior. The car looks hot, people stare at it all the time. Great performance, great pickup. The   mileage has been great so far, going to tahoe from the bay I avg 29.3, coming down I did 28.5 (i was going a little faster). I'm 6'3\\\" and fit well, don't have a whole lot of head room, but it's not an issue. Wish the trunk was a little bigger so my dog could fit a little better (great dane mix), but folding the seats will take car of that. Too bad it doesn't come with quattro in the 2.0T. I would highly recommend this car, it just puts a huge smile on my face everytime I take a turn or press the accelerator.  .  Tired of the stiff ride in my Crossfire, I needed a bit more room and ease of entry. Enter the A3. Just as fast with a turbo 4 banger as the XFire, and a \\\"softer\\\" sporty ride. Quicker than my wife's 2001 TT, the A3 can pass life's slowpokes with ease, yet makes for a nice \\\"everyday\\\" ride. I can get all the nine luggage pieces of my drum set in easily with the rear seats folded down...and still have room for a friend. Great car for city, highway or the twisties when you can. A month of driving the A3 and it's still love!.  A great car that combines function with fun. I've had my A3 for about a month and couldn't be more happy.  The 200 HP engine and DSG live up too the hype, and man, does it fly.  The interior is spacious, comfortable, with a clean design. We searched most entry-level luxury sedans but the A3 was the clear winner - nothing even compared to the driving performance of the A3.  You wouldn't know if from the inside, but the car has a ver small footprint, ideal for city driving and parking..  Third Audi, coming on the heels of a 2001 TT and an '03 A4.  This is the Goldilocks car:  not too small, not too big, just right.  Our commute got shorter this year, so this is basically a city car.  Shopped the 330i, the IS 350, the new A4, and the G35.  Loved the A3's functionality and nimble, cut-and-thrust attitude..  This is my forth Audi, through All Roads and A-4 Avants. $ for $ and pound for pound the best car Audi makes excepting for the discontinued All Road and the A-4 Cabrolet converible which is some $ 12K more expensive to equip.  I can do 35-37 mpg with a wax job and no head winds, so I can barely eek out 550 miles to a 13 gallon fill before hitting reserve, but if you want to hold 80 mph on 65 mph interstates and zip past some others in the passing lane, the economy will still hold 28 to 30 mpg. While it does not have some of the useless \\\"bells and whistles\\\" of the A-4 cousin, it's all all around functional car with plenty of storage.  Suggest you buy Continental Extreme Contacts, a great all season/snow tire with smoother ride..  What a blast to drive! Short story \\u0096 I needed to trade in the 330CIC and get something a little more practical as I was losing my winter driver (16 yr old got her permit) and my wife wouldn\\u0092t dare part with her MDX. After a lengthy search I decided to go back to Audi (have owned 3 in the past) to drive the A4. I noticed the A3 and it was love at first stomp on the gas peddle!  The DSG is unreal (paddles are fun), pick-up (turbo lag? NOT) is explosive and car is extremely comfortable. Gas mileage is great (30.5 on a recent road trip) & the creature comforts are nice (open sky, cold wthr, premium pkgs.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"customer_review_all_engines_wide_mdl_year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Its mechanics are identical to a Volkwagen GTI.
